Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy's lust.
 
Look where they come. Take but good note, and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.
 
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
 
There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
 
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
 
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

Nay, hear them, Antony. Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knows If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you, "Do this, or this. Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that. Perform 't, or else we damn thee."
 
How, my love?
 
Perchance? Nay, and most like. You must not stay here longer. Your dismission Is come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony. Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's, I would say-both? Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
 
Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall. Here is my space. Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair And such a twain can do 't, in which I bind, On pain of punishment, the world to weet We stand up peerless.

Excellent falsehood! Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her? I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony Will be himself.
 
But stirred by Cleopatra. Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours, Let's not confound the time with conference harsh. There's not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
 
Hear the ambassadors.
 
Fie, wrangling Queen! Whom every thing becomes-to chide, to laugh, To weep, whose every passion fully strives To make itself, in thee, fair and admired! No messenger but thine, and all alone Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people. Come, my Queen, Last night you did desire it.-<i>(to the </i> <b>MESSENGER</b> <i>) </i>Speak not to us.

Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly.

Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

Labienus- This is stiff news-hath with his Parthian force Extended Asia: from Euphrates His conquering banner shook, from Syria To Lydia and to Ionia, Whilst-
 
"Antony," thou wouldst say.
 
O my lord!
 
Speak to me home. Mince not the general tongue. Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome. Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults With such full license as both truth and malice Have power to utter. Oh, then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us Is as our earing.

The man from Sicyon-

He stays upon your will.
 
Let him appear.
 
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break, Or lose myself in dotage.
 
What are you?
 
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
 
Where died she?
 
In Sicyon. Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears.
 
Forbear me.
 
<i>(to himself)</i> There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it. What our contempts doth often hurl from us We wish it ours again. The present pleasure, By revolution lowering, does become The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone. The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on. I must from this enchanting Queen break off. Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know My idleness doth hatch.-How now, Enobarbus!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 22 --%%--
 
What's your pleasure, sir?
 
I must with haste from hence.
 
Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer our departure, death's the word.
 
I must be gone.
 
Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
 
She is cunning past man's thought.
 
Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears. They are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her. If it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
 
Would I had never seen her!
 
O sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.

Fulvia is dead.
 
Sir?
 
Fulvia is dead.
 
Fulvia?
 
Dead.
 
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth, comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation. Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
 
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.
 
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
 
No more light answers. Let our officers Have notice what we purpose. I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part. For not alone The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands The empire of the sea. Our slippery people, Whose love is never linked to the deserver Till his deserts are past, begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son, who-high in name and power, Higher than both in blood and life-stands up For the main soldier, whose quality, going on, The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding  Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life, And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure, To such whose place is under us, requires Our quick remove from hence.

Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him.
 
What should I do I do not?
 
In each thing give him way. Cross him in nothing.
 
Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him.
 
Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear. In time we hate that which we often fear.
 
But here comes Antony.
 
I am sick and sullen.
 
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
 
Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall. It cannot be thus long. The sides of nature Will not sustain it.

Now, my dearest Queen-

The gods best know-
 
Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.
 
Cleopatra-
 
Why should I think you can be mine, and true- Though you in swearing shake the throned gods- Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing!
 
Most sweet Queen-
 
Nay, pray you, seek no color for your going, But bid farewell and go. When you sued staying, Then was the time for words. No going then! Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven. They are so still, Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turned the greatest liar.

How now, lady?
 
I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.
 
Hear me, Queen: The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile, but my full heart Remains in use with you. Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords. Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome. Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength, Are newly grown to love. The condemned Pompey, Rich in his father's honor, creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge By any desperate change. My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia's death.
 
Though age from folly could not give me freedom, It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?
 
She's dead, my Queen.

Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awaked, at the last, best, See when and where she died.
 
O most false love! Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, In Fulvia's death how mine received shall be.
 
Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know The purposes I bear, which are or cease As you shall give th' advice. By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war As thou affects.
 
Cut my lace, Charmian, come! But let it be. I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves.
 
My precious Queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial.
 
So Fulvia told me. I prithee, turn aside and weep for her. Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene Of excellent dissembling, and let it look Like perfect honor.

Courteous lord, one word. Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it. Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it, That you know well. Something it is I would- Oh, my oblivion is a very Antony, And I am all forgotten.
 
But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you For idleness itself.
 
'Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence. Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly, And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword Sit laurel victory, and smooth success Be strewed before your feet.

You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know, It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate Our great competitor. From Alexandria This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or Vouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there A man who is th' abstract of all faults That all men follow.
 
I must not think there are Evils enough to darken all his goodness. His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven, More fiery by night's blackness, hereditary Rather than purchased, what he cannot change Than what he chooses.
 
You are too indulgent. Let's grant, it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy, To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave, To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him- As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish-yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness. If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for 't. But to confound such time That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud As his own state and ours, 'tis to be chid As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge, Pawn their experience to their present pleasure And so rebel to judgment.

Here's more news.
 
Thy biddings have been done, and every hour, Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea, And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar. To the ports The discontents repair, and men's reports Give him much wronged.
 
I should have known no less. It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were, And the ebbed man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love, Comes deared by being lacked. This common body, Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide To rot itself with motion.
 
Caesar, I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads They make in Italy-the borders maritime Lack blood to think on 't-and flush youth revolt. No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon Taken as seen, for Pompey's name strikes more Than could his war resisted.

Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against, Though daintily brought up, with patience more Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge. Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets, The barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh, Which some did die to look on. And all this- It wounds thine honor that I speak it now- Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek So much as lanked not.
 
'Tis pity of him.
 
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' th' field, and to that end Assemble we immediate council. Pompey Thrives in our idleness.

Do bravely, horse, for wott'st thou whom thou mov'st? The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm And burgonet of men. He's speaking now, Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile?" For so he calls me. Now I feed myself With most delicious poison. Think on me, That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time.

"Good friend," quoth he, "Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot, To mend the petty present, I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms.

This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for farther travel.

You do mistake your business. My brother never Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it, And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours, And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause? Of this my letters Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have to make it with, It must not be with this.
 
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patched up your excuses.

Not so, not so. I know you could not lack, I am certain on 't, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another. The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
 
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
 
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar, Made out of her impatience-which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too-I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet. For that you must But say I could not help it.
 
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria. You Did pocket up my letters and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience.

You have broken The article of your oath, which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with.
 
Soft, Caesar.
 
No, Lepidus, let him speak. The honor is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it.-But, on, Caesar. The article of my oath?
 
To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied.
 
Neglected, rather, And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may I'll play the penitent to you, but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia, To have me out of Egypt, made wars here, For which myself, the ignorant motive, do So far ask pardon as befits mine honor To stoop in such a case.
 
'Tis noble spoken.

You wrong this presence. Therefore speak no more.

Give me leave, Caesar.
 
Speak, Agrippa.
 
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side, Admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.
 
Say not so, Agrippa. If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness.

I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear Agrippa further speak.
 
To hold you in perpetual amity, To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot, take Antony Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men, Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter. By this marriage, All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales, Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke, For 'tis a studied, not a present thought, By duty ruminated.
 
Will Caesar speak?
 
Not till he hears how Antony is touched With what is spoke already.
 
What power is in Agrippa If I would say, "Agrippa, be it so," To make this good?

The power of Caesar, and His power unto Octavia.
 
May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand Further this act of grace, and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs!
 
There's my hand.
 
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly. Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never Fly off our loves again!
 
Happily, amen!

She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
 
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.
 
There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.
 
I will tell you. The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne, Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold, Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them. The oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggared all description: she did lie In her pavilion-cloth-of-gold, of tissue- O'erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature. On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.

Oh, rare for Antony!
 
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes, And made their bends adornings. At the helm A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people out upon her, and Antony, Enthroned i' th' marketplace, did sit alone, Whistling to th' air, which, but for vacancy, Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too And made a gap in nature.
 
Rare Egyptian!
 
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper. She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony, Whom ne'er the word of "No" woman heard speak, Being barbered ten times o'er, goes to the feast, And for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat only.

Royal wench! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed. He plowed her, and she cropped.
 
I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street, And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, That she did make defect perfection, And, breathless, pour breathe forth.
 
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
 
Never. He will not. Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety. Other women cloy The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies, for vilest things Become themselves in her, that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish.
 
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle The heart of Antony, Octavia is A blessed lottery to him.

True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
 
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

Who would not have his wife so?
 
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is. He married but his occasion here.

O Silius, Silius, I have done enough. A lower place, note well, May make too great an act.

Sossius, One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, For quick accumulation of renown, Which he achieved by th' minute, lost his favor. Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition, The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him.

What, man?
 
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
 
This is old. What is the success?
 
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action, and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal seizes him. So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
 
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more, And throw between them all the food thou hast, They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more In Alexandria. Here's the manner of 't: I' th' marketplace, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat Caesarion, whom they call my father's son, And all the unlawful issue that their lust Since then hath made between them. Unto her He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia, Absolute Queen.
 
This in the public eye?
 
I' th' common showplace, where they exercise. His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings: Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared, and oft before gave audience, As 'tis reported, so.

The people knows it, and have now received His accusations.
 
Who does he accuse?
 
Caesar, and that, having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets That Lepidus of the triumvirate Should be deposed, and, being, that we detain All his revenue.
 
Sir, this should be answered.
 
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone. I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel, That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change. For what I have conquered, I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia, And other of his conquered kingdoms, I Demand the like.
 
He'll never yield to that.

But you are come A market-maid to Rome and have prevented The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown, Is often left unloved. We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage With an augmented greeting.
 
Good my lord, To come thus was I not constrained, but did it On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony, Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted My grieved ear withal, whereon I begged His pardon for return.

So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
 
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers, Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, And so should you.
 
Your ships are not well manned, Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people Engrossed by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought. Their ships are yare, yours, heavy. No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, Being prepared for land.

Is Antony or we in fault for this?
 
Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason. What though you fled From that great face of war, whose several ranges Frighted each other? Why should he follow? The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed, he being The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less Than was his loss, to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing.
 
Prithee, peace.

Ay, my lord.
 
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she Will yield us up?

Wherefore is this?
 
To let a fellow that will take rewards And say "God quit you!" be familiar with My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal And plighter of high hearts!

For I have savage cause, And to proclaim it civilly were like A haltered neck which does the hangman thank For being yare about him.

Look thou say He makes me angry with him, for he seems Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry, And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't, When my good stars, that were my former guides, Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike My speech and what is done, tell him he has Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture, As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.

The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!
 
I am satisfied. Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where I will oppose his fate. Our force by land Hath nobly held. Our severed navy too Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sealike.

Do so. We'll speak to them, and tonight I'll force The wine peep through their scars.-Come on, my Queen, There's sap in 't yet. The next time I do fight I'll make Death love me, for I will contend Even with his pestilent scythe.
 
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still A diminution in our captain's brain Restores his heart. When valor preys on reason, It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek Some way to leave him.

Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony. It was divided Between her heart and lips. She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.

No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go. You have been nobly borne. <i>(to </i> <b>EROS</b> <i>) </i>From me awhile.

I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now All length is torture. Since the torch is out, Lie down and stray no farther. Now all labor Mars what it does. Yea, very force entangles Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.- Eros!-I come, my Queen.-Eros!-Stay for me. Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze. Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops, And all the haunt be ours.-Come, Eros, Eros!
 
What would my lord?
 
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword Quartered the world, and o'er green Neptune's back With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack The courage of a woman-less noble mind Than she which by her death our Caesar tells "I am conqueror of myself." Thou art sworn, Eros, That when the exigent should come which now Is come indeed, when I should see behind me Th' inevitable prosecution of Disgrace and horror, that on my command, Thou then wouldst kill me. Do 't. The time is come. Thou strik'st not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st. Put color in thy cheek.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 288 --%%--
 
The gods withhold me! Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
 
Eros, Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms, bending down His corrigible neck, his face subdued To penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded His baseness that ensued?
 
I would not see 't.
 
Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured. Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country.
 
O sir, pardon me!
 
When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once, Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed. Draw and come.
 
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
 
Lo thee!

My dear master, My captain, and my emperor, let me say, Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
 
'Tis said, man, and farewell.
 
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
 
Now, Eros.
 
Why, there then!
 
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony's death.
 
Thrice nobler than myself, Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what I should and thou couldst not. My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record. But I will be A bridegroom in my death, and run into 't As to a lover's bed. Come then, and Eros, Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus I learned of thee.

Now, my lord.
 
Where is she?
 
Locked in her monument. She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass. For when she saw- Which never shall be found-you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead. But fearing since how it might work, hath sent Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come, I dread, too late.
 
Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.

Patience is sottish, and impatience does Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women? What, what, good cheer!

Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st Appear thus to us?
 
I am called Dercetus. Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy Best to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke, He was my master, and I wore my life To spend upon his haters. If thou please To take me to thee, as I was to him I'll be to Caesar. If thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life.

But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, There was no winter in 't, an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping.

Who was last with them?
 
A simple countryman that brought her figs. This was his basket.
 
Poisoned, then.
 
Oh, Caesar, This Charmian lived but now. She stood and spake. I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.
 
Oh, noble weakness! If they had swallowed poison, 'twould appear By external swelling, but she looks like sleep, As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace.
 
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown. The like is on her arm.

Most probable That so she died, for her physician tells me She hath pursued conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument. She shall be buried by her Antony. No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous. High events as these Strike those that make them, and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented.

As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that "keeping" for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
 
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
 
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.

Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.

Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
 
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
 
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
 
Know you where you are, sir?
 
O sir, very well: here in your orchard.
 
Know you before whom, sir?
 
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.

Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this. <i>(seizes him)</i>
 
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
 
I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast railed on thyself.
 
Sweet masters, be patient. For your father's remembrance, be at accord.
 
Let me go, I say.
 
I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.
 
And what wilt thou do-beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.

Calls your Worship?
 
Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
 
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.

--%%-- pageNum: 10 --%%--
 
Good morrow to your Worship.
 
Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the new court?
 
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke. Therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
 
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be banished with her father?
 
Oh, no, for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.
 
Where will the old duke live?
 
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
 
What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 12 --%%--
 
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and, for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in. Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
 
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to 't, for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other. For I assure thee-and almost with tears I speak it-there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 14 --%%--
 
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow, I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so God keep your Worship.
 
Farewell, good Charles.
 
Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him, for my soul-yet I know not why-hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I'll go about.

I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
 
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
 
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.
 
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
 
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have, and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
 
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see-what think you of falling in love?
 
Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal, but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honor come off again.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 18 --%%--
 
What shall be our sport, then?
 
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
 
I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
 
'Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill- favoredly.
 
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.
 
No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
 
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
 
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit, whither wander you?

Mistress, you must come away to your father.
 
Were you made the messenger?
 
No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you.
 
Where learned you that oath, fool?
 
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught. Now, I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
 
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?
 
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
 
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
 
By our beards (if we had them), thou art.
 
By my knavery (if I had it), then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honor, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
 
By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.

Then shall we be news-crammed.

Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
 
Sport? Of what color?

What color, madam? How shall I answer you?
 
As wit and fortune will.
 
Or as the Destinies decrees.
 
Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.
 
Nay, if I keep not my rank-
 
Thou losest thy old smell.
 
You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
 
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
 
I will tell you the beginning, and if it please your Ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
 
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
 
There comes an old man and his three sons-
 
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
 
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.

With bills on their necks: "Be it known unto all men by these presents."
 
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke's wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
 
Alas!
 
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
 
Why, this that I speak of.
 
Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
 
Or I, I promise thee.
 
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

Come on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
 
Is yonder the man?
 
Even he, madam.
 
Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.
 
How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
 
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
 
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.
 
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.
 
I attend them with all respect and duty.
 
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
 
No, fair princess. He is the general challenger. I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
 
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
 
Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
 
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that was willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.
 
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.

No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
 
You mean to mock me after, you should not have mocked me before. But come your ways.

He cannot speak, my lord.
 
Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
 
Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
 
I would thou hadst been son to some man else. The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy. Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house. But fare thee well. Thou art a gallant youth. I would thou hadst told me of another father.

My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father's mind. Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured.
 
Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him. My father's rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart.-Sir, you have well deserved. If you do keep your promises in love But justly, as you have exceeded all promise, Your mistress shall be happy.
 
Gentleman,  <i>(giving him a chain from her neck)</i>  Wear this for me-one out of suits with fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means. -Shall we go, coz?
 
Ay.-Fare you well, fair gentleman.

Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved High commendation, true applause, and love, Yet such is now the duke's condition That he misconsters all that you have done. The duke is humorous. What he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
 
I thank you, sir, and pray you tell me this: Which of the two was daughter of the duke That here was at the wrestling?
 
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners, But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter The other is daughter to the banished duke, And here detained by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company, whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake; And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well. Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

The duke my father loved his father dearly.
 
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly. Yet I hate not Orlando.
 
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
 
Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
 
Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do. Look, here comes the duke.

I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me. If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic- As I do trust I am not-then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness.
 
Thus do all traitors. If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself. Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
 
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor. Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
 
Thou art thy father's daughter. There's enough.
 
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom. So was I when your Highness banished him. Treason is not inherited, my lord, Or if we did derive it from our friends, What's that to me? My father was no traitor. Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous.
 
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
 
Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake. Else had she with her father ranged along.

I did not then entreat to have her stay. It was your pleasure and your own remorse. I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her. If she be a traitor, Why so am I.

She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness, Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people, and they pity her. Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone. Then open not thy lips. Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.
 
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege. I cannot live out of her company.
 
You are a fool.-You, niece, provide yourself. If you outstay the time, upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word, you die.

No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one. Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl? No, let my father seek another heir. Therefore devise with me how we may fly, Whither to go, and what to bear with us, And do not seek to take your change upon you, To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out. For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
 
Why, whither shall we go?
 
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
 
Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far? Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
 
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face. The like do you. So shall we pass along And never stir assailants.
 
Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man? A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will, We'll have a swashing and a martial outside- As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances.

But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal The clownish fool out of your father's court? Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
 
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me. Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. Now go we in content To liberty, and not to banishment.

Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court? Here feel we not the penalty of Adam, The seasons' difference, as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, Which, when it bites and blows upon my body, Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say, "This is no flattery. These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am." Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head. And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything.

Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that, And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banished you. Today my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood, To the which place a poor sequestered stag That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears.
 
But what said Jaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle?
 
Oh, yes, into a thousand similes. First, for his weeping into the needless stream: "Poor deer," quoth he, "thou mak'st a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much." Then, being there alone, Left and abandoned of his velvet friend, "'Tis right," quoth he. "Thus misery doth part The flux of company." Anon a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him And never stays to greet him. "Ay," quoth Jaques, "Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens. 'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?" Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse, To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assigned and native dwelling place.

Can it be possible that no man saw them? It cannot be. Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this.

My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman, Confesses that she secretly o'erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles, And she believes wherever they are gone That youth is surely in their company.

Who's there?
 
What, my young master, O my gentle master, O my sweet master, O you memory Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here? Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you? And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke? Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies? No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. Oh, what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!
 
Why, what's the matter?
 
O unhappy youth, Come not within these doors. Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives. Your brother-no, no brother-yet the son- Yet not the son, I will not call him son- Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie, And you within it. If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off. I overheard him and his practices. This is no place, this house is but a butchery. Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
 
No matter whither, so you come not here.
 
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road? This I must do, or know not what to do. Yet this I will not do, do how I can. I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
 
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns, The thrifty hire I saved under your father, Which I did store to be my foster nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown. Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed, Yea, providently caters for the sparrow, Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold. All this I give you. Let me be your servant. Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility. Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you. I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.

O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed. Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that do choke their service up Even with the having. It is not so with thee. But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry. But come thy ways. We'll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, We'll light upon some settled low content.
 
Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore, it is too late a week. Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master's debtor.

No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow. But if thy love were ever like to mine- As sure I think did never man love so- How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
 
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
 
Oh, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily. If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved. Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress's praise, Thou hast not loved. Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved. O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!

And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, "Wear these for my sake." We that are true lovers run into strange capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.

Fair sir, I pity her And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her. But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze. My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality. Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on. But what is, come see, And in my voice most welcome shall you be.

A fool, a fool, I met a fool i' th' forest, A motley fool. A miserable world! As I do live by food, I met a fool, Who laid him down and basked him in the sun And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms, and yet a motley fool. "Good morrow, fool," quoth I. "No, sir," quoth he, "Call me not 'fool' till heaven hath sent me fortune."

And then he drew a dial from his poke And, looking on it with lackluster eye, Says very wisely, "It is ten o'clock. Thus we may see," quoth he, "how the world wags. 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more 'twill be eleven. And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, And thereby hangs a tale." When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial. O noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
 
What fool is this?
 
O worthy fool!-One that hath been a courtier And says, "If ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it." And in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms. Oh, that I were a fool! I am ambitious for a motley coat.

All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,

Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.

Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?

Then thou art damned.
 
Nay, I hope.
 
Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.

Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
 
Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
 
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.
 
Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say. Come.
 
Besides, our hands are hard.
 
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance. Come.
 
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
 
Most shallow man. Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.

That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match.

And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?
 
By no means, sir. Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons. I'll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.
 
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
 
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se'nnight, time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.
 
Who ambles time withal?
 
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain-the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.
 
Who doth he gallop withal?
 
With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
 
Who stays it still withal?
 
With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.

Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
 
I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
 
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?

No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving "Rosalind" on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy- monger I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.
 
I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.
 
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
 
What were his marks?
 
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not-but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather point-device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
 
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 136 --%%--
 
Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
 
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
 
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
 
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
 
Love is merely a madness and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do, and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love, too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
 
Did you ever cure any so?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 138 --%%--
 
Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are, for the most part, cattle of this color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
 
I would not be cured, youth.
 
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.
 
Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
 
Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?

When a man's verses cannot be understood nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
 
I do not know what "poetical" is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
 
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
 
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
 
I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest. Now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.

Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
 
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
 
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.
 
<i>(aside)</i>  I would fain see this meeting.
 
Well, the gods give us joy.
 
Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage. As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, "Many a man knows no end of his goods." Right: many a man has good horns and knows no end of them.

Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.
 
Here comes Sir Oliver.-Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
 
Is there none here to give the woman?
 
I will not take her on gift of any man.
 
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.

Not true in love?
 
Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
 
You have heard him swear downright he was.
 
"Was" is not "is." Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the duke your father.
 
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?
 
Oh, that's a brave man. He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.

But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.

It is a pretty youth-not very pretty- But sure he's proud-and yet his pride becomes him. He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue Did make offense, his eye did heal it up. He is not very tall-yet for his years he's tall. His leg is but so-so-and yet 'tis well. There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek: 'twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask. There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him In parcels as I did, would have gone near To fall in love with him; but for my part I love him not nor hate him not; and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him. For what had he to do to chide at me? He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And, now I am remembered, scorned at me. I marvel why I answered not again. But that's all one: omittance is no quittance. I'll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?

Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
 
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.
 
By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come; now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.
 
Then love me, Rosalind.
 
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
 
And wilt thou have me?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 176 --%%--
 
Ay, and twenty such.
 
What sayest thou?
 
Are you not good?
 
I hope so.
 
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?- Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.-Give me your hand, Orlando.-What do you say, sister?
 
Pray thee, marry us.
 
I cannot say the words.
 
You must begin "Will you, Orlando-"
 
Go to.-Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
 
I will.
 
Ay, but when?
 
Why, now, as fast as she can marry us.
 
Then you must say "I take thee, Rosalind, for wife."
 
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 178 --%%--
 
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions.
 
So do all thoughts. They are winged.
 
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.
 
Forever and a day.
 
Say "a day" without the "ever." No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.
 
But will my Rosalind do so?
 
By my life, she will do as I do.
 
Oh, but she is wise.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 180 --%%--
 
Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and 'twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
 
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say "Wit, whither wilt?"
 
Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed.
 
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
 
Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. Oh, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
 
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
 
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
 
I must attend the duke at dinner. By two o'clock I will be with thee again.
 
Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and so, come, death. Two o'clock is your hour?

Ay, sweet Rosalind.
 
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.
 
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.
 
Well, time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try. Adieu.
 
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate. We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
 
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love. But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
 
Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.

No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.

Which is he that killed the deer?
 
Sir, it was I.
 
Let's present him to the duke like a Roman conqueror. And it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a branch of victory.-Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
 
Yes, sir.
 
Sing it. 'Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.

I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep.
 
Look who comes here.
 
<i>(to</i> ROSALIND<i>)</i> My errand is to you, fair youth. My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this. I know not the contents, but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me. I am but as a guiltless messenger.  <i>(Gives the letter)</i>
 
<i>(Examines the letter) (as Ganymede)</i> Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all. She says I am not fair, that I lack manners. She calls me proud, and that she could not love me Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will, Her love is not the hare that I do hunt. Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This is a letter of your own device.
 
No, I protest, I know not the contents. Phoebe did write it.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 190 --%%--
 
Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love. I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand, A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands. She has a huswife's hand-but that's no matter. I say she never did invent this letter. This is a man's invention, and his hand.
 
Sure it is hers.
 
Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style, A style for challengers. Why, she defies me Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
 
So please you, for I never heard it yet, Yet heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty.
 
She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.  <i>(reads)</i> Art thou god to shepherd turned, That a maiden's heart hath burned? Can a woman rail thus?
 
Call you this railing?
 
<i>(reads)</i>  Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warr'st thou with a woman's heart? Did you ever hear such railing? Whiles the eye of man did woo me, That could do no vengeance to me. Meaning me a beast.

If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine, Alack, in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect? Whiles you chid me, I did love. How then might your prayers move? He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me, And by him seal up thy mind Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me, and all that I can make, Or else by him my love deny, And then I'll study how to die.
 
Call you this chiding?
 
<i>(as Aliena)</i> Alas, poor shepherd.
 
Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity.-Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endured. Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence and not a word, for here comes more company.
 
Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?

<i>(as Aliena)</i>  West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom, The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place. But at this hour the house doth keep itself. There's none within.
 
If that an eye may profit by a tongue, Then should I know you by description. Such garments, and such years. "The boy is fair, Of female favor, and bestows himself Like a ripe sister; the woman low And browner than her brother." Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for?
 
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
 
Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

When last the young Orlando parted from you, He left a promise to return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside- And mark what object did present itself: Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched, ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached The opening of his mouth. But suddenly, Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself And, with indented glides, did slip away Into a bush, under which bush's shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry, Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir-for 'tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead. This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
 
Oh, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.
 
And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural.
 
But to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 198 --%%--
 
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so, But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling, From miserable slumber I awaked.
 
Are you his brother?
 
Was 't you he rescued?
 
Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
 
'Twas I, but 'tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
 
But for the bloody napkin?
 
By and by. When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed- As how I came into that desert place- In brief, he led me to the gentle duke, Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, Committing me unto my brother's love, Who led me instantly unto his cave, There stripped himself, and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away, Which all this while had bled. And now he fainted, And cried in fainting upon Rosalind. Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound, And after some small space, being strong at heart,

He sent me hither, stranger as I am, To tell this story, that you might excuse His broken promise, and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
 
Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?
 
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

Look, he recovers.

Be of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man's heart.
 
I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.
 
This was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
 
Counterfeit, I assure you.

Ay, sir, I thank God.
 
"Thank God." A good answer. Art rich?
 
'Faith, sir, so-so.
 
"So-so" is good, very good, very excellent good. And yet it is not: it is but so-so. Art thou wise?
 
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
 
Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember a saying: "The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool." The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?
 
I do, sir.
 
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
 
No, sir.

Then learn this of me: to have is to have. For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other. For all your writers do consent that ipse is "he." Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
 
Which he, sir?
 
He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon-which is, in the vulgar, "leave"-the society-which in the boorish is "company"-of this female-which in the common is "woman"; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel. I will bandy with thee in faction. I will o'errun thee with policy. I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways. Therefore tremble and depart.
 
Do, good William.

It shall be to your good, for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.

Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
 
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher?
 
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
 
Oh, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's thrasonical brag of "I came, saw, and overcame." For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked, no sooner looked but they loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason, no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
 
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial. But Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes. By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.

Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
 
I can live no longer by thinking.
 
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then-for now I speak to some purpose-that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.
 
Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
 
By my life I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be married tomorrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.

Salutation and greeting to you all.
 
Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.
 
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure. I have flattered a lady. I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy. I have undone three tailors. I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
 
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
 
According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
 
But for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
 
Upon a lie seven times removed.-Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.-As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called "the retort courteous." If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called "the quip modest." If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is called "the reply churlish." If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called "the reproof valiant." If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called "the countercheck quarrelsome," and so to "the lie circumstantial" and "the lie direct."
 
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and so we measured swords and parted.
 
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
 
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, "the retort courteous"; the second, "the quip modest"; the third, "the reply churlish"; the fourth, "the reproof valiant"; the fifth, "the countercheque quarrelsome"; the sixth, "the lie with circumstance"; the seventh, "the lie direct." All these you may avoid but the lie direct, and you may avoid that, too, with an "if." I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an "if," as: "If you said so, then I said so." And they shook hands and swore brothers. Your "if" is the only peacemaker: much virtue in "if."
 
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He's as good at anything and yet a fool.
 
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
 
I will not eat my word. Now thou art mine, Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
 
Let me have audience for a word or two. I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly. Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword. And to the skirts of this wild wood he came, Where, meeting with an old religious man, After some question with him, was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world, His crown bequeathing to his banished brother, And all their lands restored to them again That were with him exiled. This to be true I do engage my life.

Welcome, young man. Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding: To one his lands withheld, and to the other A land itself at large, a potent dukedom. -First, in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot, And, after, every of this happy number That have endured shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune According to the measure of their states. Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity, And fall into our rustic revelry. -Play, music.-And you brides and bridegrooms all, With measure heaped in joy to th' measures fall.
 
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
 
He hath.
 
To him will I. Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.  <i>(to</i> DUKE SENIOR <i>)</i>  You to your former honor I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.  <i>(to</i> ORLANDO <i>)</i>  You to a love that your true faith doth merit.  <i>(to</i> OLIVER <i>)</i>  You to your land, and love, and great allies.  <i>(to</i> SILVIUS <i>)</i>  You to a long and well-deserved bed.

It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in, then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play. I am not furnished like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I'll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women- as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates them- that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.

Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, And by the doom of death end woes and all.
 
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more. I am not partial to infringe our laws. The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives, Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods, Excludes all pity from our threatening looks. For, since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, To admit no traffic to our adverse towns. Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs; Again, if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose, Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him. Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
 
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
 
A heavier task could not have been imposed Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable; Yet, that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense, I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave. In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad. With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum, till my factor's death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse; From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself-almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear- Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was. There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons, And, which was strange, the one so like the other As could not be distinguished but by names. That very hour, and in the selfsame inn, A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden, male twins, both alike. Those, for their parents were exceeding poor, I bought and brought up to attend my sons. My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, Made daily motions for our home return. Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon We came aboard.

A league from Epidamnum had we sailed Before the always-wind-obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm; But longer did we not retain much hope; For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death, Which though myself would gladly have embraced, Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, Weeping before for what she saw must come, And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear, Forced me to seek delays for them and me. And this it was, for other means was none: The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us. My wife, more careful for the latter-born, Had fastened him unto a small spare mast, Such as seafaring men provide for storms. To him one of the other twins was bound, Whilst I had been like heedful of the other. The children thus disposed, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed, Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And, floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, Dispersed those vapors that offended us, And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxed calm, and we discovered Two ships from far, making amain to us, Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this. But ere they came,-O, let me say no more! Gather the sequel by that went before.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 8 --%%--
 
Nay, forward, old man. Do not break off so, For we may pity though not pardon thee.
 
O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us. For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, We were encounterd by a mighty rock, Which being violently borne upon, Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; So that, in this unjust divorce of us, Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in, what to sorrow for. Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe, Was carried with more speed before the wind, And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. At length, another ship had seized on us And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests, And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail; And therefore homeward did they bend their course. Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss; That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
 
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

Reft of his brother, but retained his name- Might bear him company in the quest of him, Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see, I hazarded the loss of whom I loved. Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece, Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus, Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men. But here must end the story of my life; And happy were I in my timely death Could all my travels warrant me they live.
 
Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have marked To bear the extremity of dire mishap, Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, Which princes, would they, may not disannul, My soul would sue as advocate for thee. But though thou art adjudged to the death, And passed sentence may not be recalled But to our honour's great disparagement, Yet will I favor thee in what I can. Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help. Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus; Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, And live. If no, then thou art doom'd to die.- Jailer, take him to thy custody.

Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend, But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum, Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate. This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here And, not being able to buy out his life, According to the statute of the town Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. There is your money that I had to keep.
 
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee. Within this hour it will be dinnertime. Till that, I'll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary. Get thee away.
 
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed, having so good a mean.
 
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humor with his merry jests. What, will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me?

Sir, I commend you to your own content.
 
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get.

Here comes the almanac of my true date.- What now? How chance thou art returned so soon?
 
Returned so soon? Rather approach'd too late! The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek. She is so hot because the meat is cold; The meat is cold because you come not home; You come not home because you have no stomach; You have no stomach, having broke your fast; But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray Are penitent for your default today.

I am not in a sportive humor now. Tell me, and dally not: where is the money? We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody?
 
I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner. I from my mistress come to you in post; If I return, I shall be post indeed, For she will scour your fault upon my pate. Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger.
 
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season. Reserve them till a merrier hour than this. Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
 
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner. My mistress and her sister stays for you.

Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix, She that doth fast till you come home to dinner And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
 
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave. <i>(beats</i> DROMIO OF EPHESUS<i>)</i>

They say this town is full of cozenage, As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many suchlike liberties of sin. If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner. I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave. I greatly fear my money is not safe.

Why should their liberty than ours be more?
 
Because their business still lies out o' door.

By what rule, sir?
 
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
 
Let's hear it.
 
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
 
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
 
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.
 
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
 
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit.
 
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
 
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
 
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
 
For what reason?
 
For two, and sound ones too.
 
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
 
Sure ones, then.
 
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
 
Certain ones, then.
 
Name them.
 
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.
 
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
 
Marry, and did, sir: namely, e'en no time to recover hair lost by nature.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 40 --%%--
 
But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.
 
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore, to the world's end, will have bald followers.
 
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion: But soft, who wafts us yonder?
 
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown. Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects. I am not Adriana, nor thy wife. The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste, Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself? "Thyself" I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self's better part. Ah, do not tear away thyself from me! For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf, And take unmingled thence that drop again Without addition or diminishing, As take from me thyself and not me too. How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body, consecrate to thee,

I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it. I am possessed with an adulterate blot; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust; For if we too be one, and thou play false, I do digest the poison of thy flesh, Being strumpeted by thy contagion. Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed, I live disstained, thou undishonored.
 
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not. In Ephesus I am but two hours old, As strange unto your town as to your talk, Who, every word by all my wit being scanned, Want wit in all one word to understand.
 
Fie, brother, how the world is changed with you! When were you wont to use my sister thus? She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
 
By Dromio?
 
By me?
 
By thee; and this thou didst return from him: That he did buffet thee and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
 
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? What is the course and drift of your compact?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 44 --%%--
 
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
 
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
 
I never spake with her in all my life.
 
How can she thus then call us by our names- Unless it be by inspiration?
 
How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, Abetting him to thwart me in my mood. Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine. Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate. If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss, Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
 
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme. What, was I married to her in my dream? Or sleep I now and think I hear all this? What error drives our eyes and ears amiss? Until I know this sure uncertainty I'll entertain the offered fallacy.
 
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
 
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner. This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!

Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours. Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet, And that tomorrow you will bring it home. But here's a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart, and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold, And that I did deny my wife and house.- Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
 
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know. That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show; If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink, Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
 
I think thou art an ass.
 
Marry, so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear. I should kick being kicked; and, being at that pass, You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
 
And welcome more common, for that's nothing but words.
 
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

Be ruled by me; depart in patience, And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint.

If you did wed my sister for her wealth, Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness. Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth- Muffle your false love with some show of blindness. Let not my sister read it in your eye; Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator; Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty; Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger. Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted. Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint. Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted? What simple thief brags of his own attaint? 'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board. Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed; Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word. Alas, poor women, make us but believe, Being compact of credit, that you love us. Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; We in your motion turn, and you may move us. Then, gentle brother, get you in again. Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife. 'Tis holy sport to be a little vain When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

Against my soul's pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field? Are you a god? would you create me new? Transform me, then, and to your power I'll yield. But if that I am I, then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine, Nor to her bed no homage do I owe. Far more, far more, to you do I decline. O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears. Sing, Siren, for thyself, and I will dote. Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs, And as a bed I'll take them and there lie, And in that glorious supposition think He gains by death that hath such means to die.

Marry, sir, besides myself I am due to a woman, one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
 
What claim lays she to thee?
 
Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me, but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
 
What is she?
 
A very reverent body, ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say "sir-reverence." I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
 
How dost thou mean a "fat marriage"?

No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
 
What's her name?
 
Nell, sir, but her name and three quarters-that's an ell and three quarters-will not measure her from hip to hip.
 
Then she bears some breadth?
 
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip. She is spherical, like a globe. I could find out countries in her.

Marry, sir, in her buttocks. I found it out by the bogs.

Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
 
O, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me, call'd me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch. And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel, She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' th' wheel.
 
Go, hie thee presently. Post to the road. An if the wind blow any way from shore, I will not harbor in this town tonight. If any bark put forth, come to the mart, Where I will walk till thou return to me. If every one knows us, and we know none, 'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.

I understand thee not.

No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a bass viol in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
 
What, thou meanest an officer?
 
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says "God give you good rest."
 
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any ships put forth tonight? May we be gone?
 
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark  <i>Expedition</i> put forth tonight, and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy <i>Delay</i>. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.
 
The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions. Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
 
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus. I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now. Is that the chain you promised me today?
 
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

Nay, she is worse; she is the devil's dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench. And thereof comes that the wenches say "God damn me" that's as much to say "God make me a light wench." It is written they appear to men like angels of light. Light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn: ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
 
Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir. Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.
 
Master, if you do, expect spoon meat; or bespeak a long spoon.
 
Why, Dromio?
 
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil.
 
(<i>to</i> COURTESAN) Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping? Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress. I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, a rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, a cherrystone; but she, more covetous, would have a chain. Master, be wise. An if you give it her, the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
 
I pray you, sir, my ring or else the chain. I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
 
Avaunt, thou witch!-Come, Dromio, let us go.
 
"Fly pride," says the peacock. Mistress, that you know.
 
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad; Else would he never so demean himself. A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, And for the same he promised me a chain. Both one and other he denies me now. The reason that I gather he is mad, Besides this present instance of his rage, Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance. Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, On purpose shut the doors against his way. My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that, being lunatic, He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away. This course I fittest choose, For forty ducats is too much to lose.

Here comes my man. I think he brings the money. How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?
 
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
 
But where's the money?
 
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
 
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
 
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
 
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
 
To a rope's end, sir, and to that end am I returned.

Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.
 
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears.-I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating. I am waked with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

How long hath this possession held the man?
 
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was. But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
 
Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea? Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye Stray'd his affection in unlawful love, A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing? Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
 
To none of these, except it be the last, Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
 
You should for that have reprehended him.

It was the copy of our conference. In bed he slept not for my urging it; At board he fed not for my urging it. Alone, it was the subject of my theme; In company I often glanced it. Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
 
And thereof came it that the man was mad. The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth. It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing, And therefore comes it that his head is light. Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings. Unquiet meals make ill digestions. Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what's a fever but a fit of madness? Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls. Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturbed, would mad or man or beast. The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband, Whom I made lord of me and all I had At your important letters, this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him, That desp'rately he hurried through the street, With him his bondman, all as mad as he, Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses, bearing thence Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like. Once did I get him bound and sent him home Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went That here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, He broke from those that had the guard of him, And with his mad attendant and himself, Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, Met us again and, madly bent on us, Chased us away, till, raising of more aid, We came again to bind them. Then they fled Into this abbey, whither we pursued them, And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him out, Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

My master preaches patience to him, and the while His man with scissors nicks him like a fool; And sure, unless you send some present help, Between them they will kill the conjurer.

This woman locked me out this day from dinner. That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthasar and I did dine together. Our dinner done and he not coming thither, I went to seek him. In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman. <i>(points to the</i> SECOND MERCHANT<i>)</i>  There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain, Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which He did arrest me with an officer. I did obey, and sent my peasant home For certain ducats. He with none returned. Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house. By th' way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates. Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced villain, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller, A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, A living dead man. This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,

My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him: That he dined not at home, but was locked out.
 
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
 
He had, my lord, and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck.
 
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart, And thereupon I drew my sword on you, And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence I think you are come by miracle.
 
I never came within these abbey walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me. I never saw the chain, so help me heaven, And this is false you burden me withal.

This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me. I see we still did meet each other's man, And I was ta'en for him, and he for me, And thereupon these errors are arose.
 
These ducats pawn I for my father here.
 
It shall not need. Thy father hath his life.
 
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
 
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
 
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes, And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathized one day's error Have suffered wrong. Go, keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction.- Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er delivered.- The Duke, my husband, and my children both, And you, the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me. After so long grief, such nativity!
 
With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast.

Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?
 
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
 
He speaks to me.-I am your master, Dromio. Come, go with us. We'll look to that anon. Embrace thy brother there. Rejoice with him.
 
There is a fat friend at your master's house That kitchened me for you today at dinner. She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
 
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
 
Not I, sir. You are my elder.
 
That's a question. How shall we try it?
 
We'll draw cuts for the signior. Till then, lead thou first.
 
Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

Welcome, Horatio.-Welcome, good Marcellus.
 
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
 
I have seen nothing.
 
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us. Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one-
 
Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again!
 
In the same figure like the king that's dead.
 
<i>(to</i> HORATIO<i>)</i> Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
 
Looks it not like the king? Mark it, Horatio.
 
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
 
It would be spoke to.
 
Question it, Horatio.
 
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee, speak.

How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on 't?
 
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.
 
Is it not like the king?
 
As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated. So frowned he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.
 
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
 
In what particular thought to work I know not, But in the gross and scope of mine opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

Good now, sit down and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war, Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day? Who is 't that can inform me?
 
That can I. At least, the whisper goes so: our last king, Whose image even but now appeared to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteemed him) Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of to the conqueror, Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king, which had returned To the inheritance of Fortinbras Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant And carriage of the article designed, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in 't, which is no other- As it doth well appear unto our state- But to recover of us, by strong hand
 
--%%-- pageNum: 12 --%%--
 
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost. And this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.
 
I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.
 
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun, and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of feared events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen.
 
But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again. I'll cross it though it blast me.-Stay, illusion!

-Stop it, Marcellus.
 
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
 
Do, if it will not stand.
 
'Tis here.
 
'Tis here.
 
'Tis gone. We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence, For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.
 
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 16 --%%--
 
And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day, and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine, and of the truth herein This present object made probation.
 
It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long. And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad. The nights are wholesome. Then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallowed and so gracious is that time.
 
So have I heard and do in part believe it. But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. Break we our watch up, and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
 
Let's do 't, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.

Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we-as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole- Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not failed to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him.

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit. What is 't, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
 
My dread lord, Your leave and favor to return to France, From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will.- But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
 
<i>(aside)</i> A little more than kin and less than kind.
 
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
 
Not so, my lord. I am too much i' the sun.
 
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not forever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust. Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.
 
Ay, madam, it is common.
 
If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?

"Seems," madam? Nay, it is. I know not "seems." 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, That can denote me truly. These indeed "seem," For they are actions that a man might play. But I have that within which passeth show, These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
 
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father. But you must know your father lost a father, That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief. It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschooled. For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'Tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died today, "This must be so." We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father. For let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne,

Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.
 
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
 
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark.-Madam, come. This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.

Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears. Why she, even she- O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourned longer!-married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow student. I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
 
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
 
For God's love, let me hear.
 
Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encountered: a figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes Within his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch, Where-as they had delivered, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good- The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.
 
But where was this?

My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
 
Did you not speak to it?
 
My lord, I did, But answer made it none. Yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak. But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanished from our sight.
 
'Tis very strange.
 
As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true. And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
 
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch tonight?
 
We do, my lord.
 
Armed, say you?
 
Armed, my lord.
 
From top to toe?
 
My lord, from head to foot.
 
Then saw you not his face?
 
Oh yes, my lord. He wore his beaver up.

What, looked he frowningly?
 
A countenance more In sorrow than in anger.
 
Pale or red?
 
Nay, very pale.
 
And fixed his eyes upon you?
 
Most constantly.
 
I would I had been there.
 
It would have much amazed you.
 
Very like. Stayed it long?
 
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
 
Longer, longer.
 
Not when I saw 't.
 
His beard was grizzled, no?
 
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.

If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.

I will requite your loves. So fare you well. Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.
 
Our duty to your honor.
 
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

No more but so?
 
Think it no more. For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will, but you must fear. His greatness weighed, his will is not his own, For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state. And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,

It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed, which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity. Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosed. And in the morn and liquid dew of youth, Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary, then. Best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
 
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.
 
O, fear me not.

Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for. There, my blessing with thee. And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel, But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear but few thy voice. Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy-rich, not gaudy, For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be, For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee.

Marry, well bethought. 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you, and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so as so 'tis put on me- And that in way of caution-I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor. What is between you? Give me up the truth.
 
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.
 
Affection! Pooh, you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his "tenders," as you call them?
 
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
 
Marry, I'll teach you. Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly, Or-not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus-you'll tender me a fool.

And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
 
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to 't, I charge you. Come your ways.

From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel linked, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! Methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment, whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body And with a sudden vigor doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine. And a most instant tetter barked about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched, Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris, And how, and who, what means, and where they keep What company at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus: "I know his father and his friends, And, in part, him." Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
 
Ay, very well, my lord.

'Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency. That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.
 
But, my good lord-
 
Wherefore should you do this?
 
Ay, my lord. I would know that.
 
Marry, sir, here's my drift: (And I believe it is a fetch of wit) You, laying these slight sullies on my son As 'twere a thing a little soiled i' th' working- Mark you, your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured He closes with you in this consequence: "Good sir" or so, or "Friend," or "Gentleman," According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country.

At "closes in the consequence," at "'friend,' Or so" and "'gentleman.'"
 
At "closes in the consequence." Ay, marry. He closes thus: "I know the gentleman. I saw him yesterday"-or "t' other day," Or then, or then, with such or such-"and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o'ertook in's rouse, There falling out at tennis," or, perchance, "I saw him enter such a house of sale"-  <i>Videlicet</i> a brothel, or so forth.

My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled, Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors-he comes before me.
 
Mad for thy love?
 
My lord, I do not know. But truly, I do fear it.
 
What said he?
 
He took me by the wrist and held me hard. Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stayed he so.

At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And, with his head over his shoulder turned, He seemed to find his way without his eyes, For out o' doors he went without their helps, And to the last bended their light on me.
 
Come, go with me. I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late?
 
No, my good lord. But as you did command I did repel his fetters and denied His access to me.
 
That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him. I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king. This must be known, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Come.

What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from th' understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both That, being of so young days brought up with him And since so neighbored to his youth and 'havior, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus That, opened, lies within our remedy.

What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: "Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star. This must not be." And then I prescripts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repelled-a short tale to make- Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves And all we mourn for.

I have of late-but wherefore I know not-lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises, and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air-look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire-why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the world. The paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me. No, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
 
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
 
Why did you laugh then, when I said "man delights not me"?
 
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
 
He that plays the king shall be welcome. His majesty shall have tribute of me. The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for 't. What players are they?

How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
 
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
 
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
 
No, indeed are they not.
 
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
 
Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace. But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for 't. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages-so they call them-that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.

What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
 
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
 
Is 't possible?
 
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.

Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.
 
It is not very strange. For my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
 
There are the players.
 
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then. Th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb-lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome.

You are welcome, masters, welcome, all!-I am glad to see thee well.-Welcome, good friends.-O old friend? Why, thy face is valenced since I saw thee last. Comest thou to beard me in Denmark?-What, my young lady and mistress! By 'r Lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.

What speech, my good lord?
 
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted. Or, if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million. 'Twas caviary to the general. But it was-as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine-an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.

One speech in it I chiefly loved. 'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido and thereabout of it, especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your >memory, begin at this line-Let me see, let me see-  <i>The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast</i>- It is not so. It begins with Pyrrhus-  <i>The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms</i>,  <i>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</i>   <i>When he lay couched in the ominous horse</i>,  <i>Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared</i>   <i>With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot</i>   <i>Now is he total gules, horridly tricked</i>   <i>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons</i>,  <i>Baked and impasted with the parching streets</i>,  <i>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</i>   <i>To their lord's murder. Roasted in wrath and fire</i>,  <i>And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore</i>,  <i>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</i>   <i>Old grandsire Priam seeks</i>. So, proceed you.

Then senseless Ilium</i>,  <i>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</i>   <i>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</i>   <i>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck, lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him.

Oh, my offence is rank. It smells to heaven. It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't, A brother's murder. Pray can I not. Though inclination be as sharp as will, My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood? Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what's in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall Or pardoned being down? Then I'll look up. My fault is past. But oh, what form of prayer Can serve my turn, "Forgive me my foul murder"?

There the action lies In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? What rests? Try what repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it when one can not repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels. Make assay.

To give the world assurance of a man. This was your husband. Look you now, what follows. Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this moor? Ha, have you eyes? You cannot call it love, for at your age The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgment. And what judgment Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have, Else could you not have motion. But sure that sense Is apoplexed, for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled, But it reserved some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference. What devil was 't That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?

<i>(from within)</i> Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
 
But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet? Oh, here they come.
 
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
 
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
 
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.
 
Do not believe it.
 
Believe what?
 
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! What replication should be made by the son of a king?
 
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 218 --%%--
 
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
 
I understand you not, my lord.
 
I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
 
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king.
 
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing-
 
A thing, my lord?
 
Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide, fox, and all after.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 220 --%%--
 
I have sent to seek him and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him. He's loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes. And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weighed, But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all.
 
How now, what hath befall'n?
 
Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, We cannot get from him.
 
But where is he?
 
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
 
Bring him before us.
 
Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
 
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 222 --%%--
 
At supper.
 
At supper where?
 
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service-two dishes, but to one table. That's the end.
 
Alas, alas!
 
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
 
What dost you mean by this?
 
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
 
Where is Polonius?
 
In heaven. Send hither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But if indeed you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
 
<i>(to attendants)</i> Go seek him there.

For England?
 
Ay, Hamlet.
 
Good.
 
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
 
Yes, it is already garrisoned.
 
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw. This is th' impostume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks and shows no cause without Why the man dies.-I humbly thank you, sir.

How stand I then, That have a father killed, a mother stained, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep-while, to my shame, I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men, That for a fantasy and trick of fame Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain?

Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.

It falls right. You have been talked of since your travel much- And that in Hamlet's hearing-for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine. Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.
 
What part is that, my lord?
 
A very ribbon in the cap of youth, Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy. I've seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback. But this gallant Had witchcraft in 't. He grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As he had been encorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought, That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.

Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him. Now, out of this-
 
What out of this, my lord?
 
Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?
 
Why ask you this?
 
Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it. And nothing is at a like goodness still. For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in his own too-much. That we would do, We should do when we would, for this "would" changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents. And then this "should" is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing.-But to the quick of th' ulcer: Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake To show yourself in deed your father's son More than in words?

No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize. Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet returned shall know you are come home. We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads. He, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father.
 
I will do 't. And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratched withal. I'll touch my point With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly It may be death.

There is a willow grows aslant a brook That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do "dead men's fingers" call them. There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke, When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide, And mermaid-like a while they bore her up, Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element. But long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death.

What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
 
The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.

Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born, he that is mad and sent into England.

Why, because he was mad. He shall recover his wits there, or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
 
Why?
 
'Twill not be seen in him there. There the men are as mad as he.
 
How came he mad?
 
Very strangely, they say.

Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. <i>(indicates a skull)</i> Here's a skull now. This skull has lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.

E'en that.
 
Let me see. <i>(takes the skull)</i> Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times, and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. -Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? Your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your own grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favor she must come.

To what base uses we may return, Horatio. Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
 
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
 
No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it, as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust, the dust is earth, of earth we make loam-and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!

For charitable prayers Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her. Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.
 
Must there no more be done?
 
No more be done. We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.
 
Lay her i' th' earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.

Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
 
O my son, what theme?
 
I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
 
O, he is mad, Laertes.
 
For love of God, forbear him.
 
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do. Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up eisel, eat a crocodile? I'll do 't. Dost thou come here to whine, To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her?-and so will I. And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou.
 
This is mere madness. And thus a while the fit will work on him. Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.

Hear you, sir. What is the reason that you use me thus? I loved you ever. But it is no matter. Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

<i>(to</i> LAERTES<i>)</i> Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech. We'll put the matter to the present push.- Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.- This grave shall have a living monument. An hour of quiet shortly shall we see. Till then in patience our proceeding be.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 300 --%%--
 
So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other. You do remember all the circumstance?
 
Remember it, my lord?
 
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly- And praised be rashness for it: let us know Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well When our deep plots do pall, and that should teach us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will-
 
That is most certain.
 
Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark Groped I to find out them, had my desire, Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again, making so bold (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal Their grand commission, where I found, Horatio- O royal knavery!-an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health, and England's too, With-ho!-such bugs and goblins in my life That, on the supervise (no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the ax) My head should be struck off.

<i>(shows</i> HORATIO <i>a document)</i>  Here's the commission. Read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
 
I beseech you.
 
Being thus benetted round with villainies- Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play-I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair. I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labored much How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know Th' effect of what I wrote?
 
Ay, good my lord.
 
An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many suchlike "as's" of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving time allowed.
 
How was this sealed?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 304 --%%--
 
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal. Folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subscribed it, gave 't th' impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already.
 
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't.
 
Why, man, they did make love to this employment. They are not near my conscience. Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow. 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.
 
Why, what a king is this!
 
Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon- He that hath killed my king and whored my mother, Popped in between th' election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life (And with such cozenage!)-is 't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm? And is 't not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
 
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.

It will be short. The interim's mine. And a man's life's no more than to say "one." But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself, For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his. I'll court his favors. But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.
 
Peace.-Who comes here?
 
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
 
I humbly thank you, sir. <i>(aside to</i> HORATIO<i>)</i> Dost know this water-fly?

Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty.

I beseech you, remember-<i>(indicates that</i> OSRIC <i>should put on his hat)</i>
 
Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes, believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.
 
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.

But in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror. And who else would trace him? His umbrage, nothing more.
 
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
 
The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?
 
Sir?
 
<i>(aside to</i> HAMLET<i>)</i> Is 't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do 't, sir, really.
 
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
 
Of Laertes?
 
<i>(aside to</i> HAMLET<i>)</i> His purse is empty already. All 's golden words are spent.
 
Of him, sir.
 
I know you are not ignorant-
 
I would you did, sir. Yet in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
 
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
 
--%%-- pageNum: 312 --%%--
 
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well were to know himself.
 
I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
 
What's his weapon?
 
Rapier and dagger.
 
That's two of his weapons. But well.
 
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns-as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
 
What call you the carriages?
 
<i>(aside to</i> HAMLET<i>)</i> I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.
 
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
 
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages-that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this "impawned," as you call it?
 
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 314 --%%--
 
How if I answer "No"?
 
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
 
Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please His Majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose. I will win for him an I can. If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
 
Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
 
To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
 
I commend my duty to your lordship.
 
Yours, yours.
 
He does well to commend it himself. There are no tongues else for 's turn.
 
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
 
He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it. Thus has he-and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on-only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
 
I am constant to my purpose. They follow the king's pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready, now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
 
The king and queen and all are coming down.
 
In happy time.
 
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
 
She well instructs me.
 
You will lose this wager, my lord.
 
I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
 
Nay, good my lord-
 
It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.

What I have done, That might your nature, honor, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was 't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not. Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged. His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience,

So shaken as we are, so wan with care, Find we a time for frighted peace to pant And breathe short-winded accents of new broils To be commenced in strands afar remote. No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood. Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields, Nor bruise her flow'rets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes, Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, All of one nature, of one substance bred, Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, March all one way and be no more opposed Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies. The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife, No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends, As far as to the sepulcher of Christ- Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross We are impressed and engaged to fight- Forthwith a power of English shall we levy, Whose arms were molded in their mothers' womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walked those blessed feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed For our advantage on the bitter cross.

But this our purpose now is twelve month old, And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go. Therefor we meet not now. Then let me hear Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, What yesternight our council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience.
 
My liege, this haste was hot in question, And many limits of the charge set down But yesternight: when all athwart there came A post from Wales loaden with heavy news, Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer, Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight Against the irregular and wild Glendower, Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken, A thousand of his people butchered, Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse, Such beastly shameless transformation By those Welshwomen done, as may not be Without much shame retold or spoken of.
 
It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
 
This matched with other did, my gracious lord. For more uneven and unwelcome news Came from the north and thus it did import: On Holy-rood Day, the gallant Hotspur there, Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald, That ever valiant and approved Scot, At Holmedon met, where they did spend A sad and bloody hour- As by discharge of their artillery And shape of likelihood the news was told; For he that brought them, in the very heat And pride of their contention did take horse, Uncertain of the issue any way.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 7 --%%--
 
Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend, Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse. Stained with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours, And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news. The Earl of Douglas is discomfited; Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights, Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners Hotspur took Mordake, Earl of Fife, and eldest son To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Atholl, Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith. And is not this an honorable spoil? A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
 
In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
 
Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, and mak'st me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son, A son who is the theme of Honor's tongue, Amongst a grove the very straightest plant, Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride; Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, See riot and dishonor stain the brow Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged In cradle-clothes our children where they lay, And called mine "Percy," his "Plantagenet"! Then would I have his Harry, and he mine. But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz, Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners, Which he in this adventure hath surprised To his own use he keeps, and sends me word I shall have none but Mordake, Earl of Fife.

Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
 
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colored taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.
 
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he,that wand'ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as God save thy Grace-Majesty, I should say, for grace thou wilt have none-
 
What, none?
 
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.
 
Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.
 
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty. Let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.

Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with swearing "Lay by" and spent with crying "Bring in"; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
 
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
 
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
 
How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?

No, I'll give thee thy due. Thou hast paid all there.
 
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have used my credit.
 
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent-But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
 
No, thou shalt.
 
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
 
Thou judgest false already: I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.
 
Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.

Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
 
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moorditch?
 
Thou hast the most unsavory similes, and art indeed the most comparative, rascaliest, sweet young Prince. But, Hal, I comparative, rascaliest, sweet young Prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talked wisely, and in the street, too.
 
Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it.
 
O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it. Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain. I'll be damned for never a king's son in Christendom.

Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal. 'Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.

Good morrow, sweet Hal.-What says Monsieur Remorse? What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?

I have vizards for you all. You have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns. If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.
 
Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you for going.
 
You will, chops?
 
Hal, wilt thou make one?
 
Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
 
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam'st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
 
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
 
Why, that's well said.
 
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.

Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be believed, that the true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell. You shall find me in Eastcheap.
 
Farewell, thou latter spring. Farewell, All-hallown summer.
 
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid. Yourself and I will not be there. And when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.
 
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
 
Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them.
 
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment to be ourselves.

Tut, our horses they shall not see; I'll tie them in the wood. Our vizards we will change after we leave them. And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
 
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
 
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.
 
Well, I'll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap. There I'll sup. Farewell.
 
Farewell, my lord.
 
I know you all, and will awhile uphold The unyoked humor of your idleness. Yet herein will I imitate the sun, Who doth permit the base contagious clouds To smother up his beauty from the world, That, when he please again to be himself, Being wanted, he may be more wondered at By breaking through the foul and ugly mist Of vapors that did seem to strangle him.

Yea, my good lord. Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded, Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took, Were, as he says, not with such strength denied As is delivered to your Majesty: Either envy, therefore, or misprison Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.
 
My liege, I did deny no prisoners. But I remember, when the fight was done, When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword, Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dressed, Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped Showed like a stubble land at harvest home. He was perfumed like a milliner, And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held A pouncet box, which ever and anon He gave his nose and took 't away again, Who therewith angry, when it next came there, Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked. And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly, To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility. With many holiday and lady terms He questioned me; amongst the rest demanded My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf. I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold, To be so pestered with a popinjay, Out of my grief and my impatience Answered neglectingly I know not what- He should, or he should not; for he made me mad To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

Of guns, and drums, and wounds-God save the mark!- And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth Was parmacety for an inward bruise, And that it was great pity, so it was, This villanous saltpeter should be digged Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed So cowardly, and but for these vile guns He would himself have been a soldier. This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, I answered indirectly, as I said, And I beseech you, let not his report Come current for an accusation Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.
 
The circumstance considered, good my lord, Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said To such a person and in such a place, At such a time, with all the rest retold, May reasonably die and never rise To do him wrong or any way impeach What then he said, so he unsay it now.
 
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners, But with proviso and exception That we at our own charge shall ransom straight His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer, Who, on my soul, hath willfully betrayed The lives of those that he did lead to fight Against that great magician, damned Glendower, Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then Be emptied to redeem a traitor home? Shall we buy treason and indent with fears When they have lost and forfeited themselves? No, on the barren mountains let him starve, For I shall never hold that man my friend Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

Revolted Mortimer! He never did fall off, my sovereign liege, But by the chance of war. To prove that true Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds, Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank In single opposition hand to hand He did confound the best part of an hour In changing hardiment with great Glendower. Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink, Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood, Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks, Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, Bloodstained with these valiant combatants. Never did bare and rotten policy Color her working with such deadly wounds, Nor could the noble Mortimer Receive so many, and all willingly. Then let not him be slandered with revolt.
 
Thou dost belie him, Percy; thou dost belie him. He never did encounter with Glendower. I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone As Owen Glendower for an enemy. Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.

Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust, But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer As high in the air as this unthankful King, As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.

And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
 
But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer Heir to the crown?
 
He did; myself did hear it.
 
Nay then, I cannot blame his cousin King That wished him on the barren mountains starve. But shall it be that you that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man And for his sake wear the detested blot Of murderous subornation-shall it be That you a world of curses undergo, Being the agents or base second means, The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?

No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem Your banished honors and restore yourselves Into the good thoughts of the world again, Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt Of this proud King, who studies day and night To answer all the debt he owes to you Even with the bloody payment of your deaths. Therefore I say-
 
Peace, cousin, say no more. And now I will unclasp a secret book, And to your quick-conceiving discontents I'll read you matter deep and dangerous, As full of peril and adventurous spirit As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
 
If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim! Send danger from the east unto the west, So honor cross it from the north to south, And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
 
Imagination of some great exploit Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
 
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon, Or dive into the bottom of the deep, Where fathom line could never touch the ground, And pluck up drowned honor by the locks, So he that doth redeem her thence might wear Without corrival all her dignities.

I think this be the most villanous house in all London road for fleas. I am stung like a tench.

I have a gammon of bacon and two races of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing Cross.
 
God's body, the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.- What, ostler! A plague on thee! Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Canst not hear? An 'twere not as good deed as drink to break the pate on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged. Hast no faith in thee?
 
Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
 
I think it be two o'clock.
 
I prithee, lend me thy lantern to see my gelding in the stable.
 
Nay, by God, soft. I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.

What ho, chamberlain!
 
<i>(within)</i> At hand, quoth pickpurse.
 
That's even as fair as "at hand, quoth the Chamberlain," for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from laboring: thou layest the plot how.
 
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper-a kind of auditor, one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already and call for eggs and butter. They will away presently.
 
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll give thee this neck.

No, I'll none of it. I pray thee keep that for the hangman, for I know thou worshipest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may.
 
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I'll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut, there are other Troyans that thou dream'st not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace, that would, if matters should be looked into, for their own credit sake make all whole. I am joined with no foot-land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray, and yet, zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint the commonwealth, or rather not pray to her but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots.
 
What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water in foul way?
 
She will, she will. Justice hath liquored her. We steal as in a castle, cocksure. We have the receipt of fern seed; we walk invisible.
 
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern seed for your walking invisible.

Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I 'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged.

Tell me, sweet lord, what is 't that takes from thee Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep? Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth And start so often when thou sit'st alone? Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks And given my treasures and my rights of thee To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy? In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched, And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars, Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed, Cry "Courage! To the field!" And thou hast talk'd Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets, Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin, Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain, And all the currents of a heady fight. Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war, And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep, That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream, And in thy face strange motions have appeared, Such as we see when men restrain their breath On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these? Some heavy business hath my lord in hand, And I must know it, else he loves me not.

With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very bass string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly am no proud jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy-by the Lord, so they call me-and when I am King of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep "dyeing scarlet," and when you breathe in your watering, they cry "Hem!" and bid you "Play it off!" To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action; but, sweet Ned-to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than "Eight shillings and sixpence," and "You are welcome," with this shrill addition, "Anon, anon, sir.-Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon," or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling "Francis," that his tale to me may be nothing but "Anon." Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent.

Then did we two set on you four and, with a word, outfaced you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house.

Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules, but beware instinct. The lion will not touch the true Prince. Instinct is a great matter. I was now a coward on instinct.

Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
 
Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked?
 
Why, he hacked it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
 
Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before: I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.

O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou ran'st away. What instinct hadst thou for it?
 
My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these exhalations?
 
I do.

Hot livers and cold purses.
 
Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
 
No, if rightly taken, halter.
 
Here comes lean Jack. Here comes bare-bone.-How now, my sweet creature of bombast? How long is 't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
 
My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist. I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring. A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad. Here was Sir John Bracy from your father. You must to the court in the morning.

You have hit it.
 
So did he never the sparrow.
 
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him. He will not run.
 
Why, what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for running?
 
A-horseback, you cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot.
 
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? Doth not thy blood thrill at it?
 
Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
 
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father. If thou love me, practice an answer.

Thy state is taken for a joined stool, thy golden scepter for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown.

Peace, good pint-pot. Peace, good tickle-brain.- <i>(to</i> PRINCE HENRY <i>)</i> Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, so youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish-hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be asked. Shall the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak to thee, in drink but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 117 --%%--
 
What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?
 
A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or, by 'r Lady, inclining to three score; and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it: there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?
 
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll play my father.
 
Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit- sucker or a poulter's hare.
 
Well, here I am set.
 
And here I stand. - <i>(to the others)</i> Judge, my masters.
 
Now, Harry, whence come you?
 
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
 
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

'Sblood, my lord, they are false.- <i>(to the others)</i> Nay, I'll tickle you for a young prince, i' faith.
 
Swearest thou? Ungracious boy, henceforth ne'er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man. A tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloakbag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend Vice, that gray iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning but in craft? Wherein crafty but in villany? Wherein villanous but in all things? Wherein worthy but in nothing?
 
I would your Grace would take me with you. Whom means your Grace?
 
That villanous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
 
My lord, the man I know.
 
I know thou dost.
 
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know. That he is old, the more the pity; his white hairs do witness it. But that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked. If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being, as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's company. Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

One of them is well known, my gracious lord, A gross fat man.

The man, I do assure you is not here, For I myself at this time have employed him. And, Sheriff, I will engage my word to thee That I will by tomorrow dinner time Send him to answer thee or any man For any thing he shall be charged withal. And so let me entreat you leave the house.
 
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
 
It may be so. If he have robbed these men, He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
 
Good night, my noble lord.

Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.

Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower, Will you sit down? And Uncle Worcester- A plague upon it, I have forgot the map.
 
No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy Sit, good cousin Hotspur, for by that name As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you His cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh He wisheth you in heaven.
 
And you in hell, As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
 
I cannot blame him. At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets, and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shaked like a coward.
 
Why, so it would have done At the same season if your mother's cat Had but kittened, though yourself had never been born.
 
I say the earth did shake when I was born.

And I say the earth was not of my mind, If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
 
The heavens were all on fire; the earth did tremble.
 
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire, And not in fear of your nativity. Diseas-d nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving, Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth Our grandam earth, having this distemperature, In passion shook.
 
Cousin, of many men I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. These signs have marked me extraordinary, And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men. Where is he living, clipped in with the sea That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, Which calls me pupil or hath read to me? And bring him out that is but woman's son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments.

Why, so can I, or so can any man, But will they come when you do call for them?
 
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.
 
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil By telling truth. Tell truth and shame the devil. If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither, And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence. O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!

Come, here's the map. Shall we divide our right According to our threefold order ta'en?
 
The Archdeacon hath divided it Into three limits very equally: England, from Trent and Severn hitherto, By south and east is to my part assigned;

All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore, And all the fertile land within that bound To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you The remnant northward, lying off from Trent. And our indentures tripartite are drawn, Which being sealed interchangeably- A business that this night may execute- Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish power, As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury. My father Glendower is not ready yet, Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.  <i>(to</i> GLENDOWER <i>)</i> Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen.
 
A shorter time shall send me to you, lords, And in my conduct shall your ladies come, From whom you now must steal and take no leave, For there will be a world of water shed Upon the parting of your wives and you.
 
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, In quantity equals not one of yours. See how this river comes me cranking in And cuts me from the best of all my land A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out. I'll have the current in this place dammed up, And here the smug and silver Trent shall run In a new channel, fair and evenly. It shall not wind with such a deep indent, To rob me of so rich a bottom here.

I cannot choose. Sometime he angers me With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant, Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, And of a dragon and a finless fish, A clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven, A couching lion and a ramping cat, And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff As puts me from my faith. I tell you what- He held me last night at least nine hours In reckoning up the several devils' names That were his lackeys. I cried "Hum," and "Well, go to," But marked him not a word.

In faith, he is a worthy gentleman, Exceedingly well read and profited In strange concealments, valiant as a lion, And as wondrous affable, and as bountiful As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin? He holds your temper in a high respect And curbs himself even of his natural scope When you come cross his humor. Faith, he does. I warrant you that man is not alive Might so have tempted him as you have done Without the taste of danger and reproof. But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.

You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault. Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood- And that's the dearest grace it renders you- Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage, Defect of manners, want of government, Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain, The least of which, haunting a nobleman, Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain Upon the beauty of all parts besides, Beguiling them of commendation.

But thou dost in thy passages of life Make me believe that thou art only marked For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else, Could such inordinate and low desires, Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts, Such barren pleasures, rude society As thou art matched withal, and grafted to, Accompany the greatness of thy blood, And hold their level with thy princely heart?
 
So please your Majesty, I would I could Quit all offenses with as clear excuse As well as I am doubtless I can purge Myself of many I am charged withal.

God pardon thee. Yet let me wonder, Harry, At thy affections, which do hold a wing Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors. Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost, Which by thy younger brother is supplied, And art almost an alien to the hearts Of all the court and princes of my blood. The hope and expectation of thy time Is ruined, and the soul of every man Prophetically doth forethink thy fall. Had I so lavish of my presence been, So common-hackneyed in the eyes of men, So stale and cheap to vulgar company, Opinion, that did help me to the crown, Had still kept loyal to possession And left me in reputeless banishment, A fellow of no mark nor likelihood. By being seldom seen, I could not stir But like a comet I was wondered at; That men would tell their children "This is he." Others would say "Where? Which is Bolingbroke?" And then I stole all courtesy from heaven, And dressed myself in such humility That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts, Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths, Even in the presence of the crowned King. Thus did I keep my person fresh and new, My presence, like a robe pontifical, Ne'er seen but wondered at, and so my state, Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast And won by rareness such solemnity. The skipping King, he ambled up and down With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits, Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state, Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools,

Had his great name profaned with their scorns, And gave his countenance, against his name, To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push Of every beardless vain comparative; Grew a companion to the common streets, Enfeoffed himself to popularity, That, being daily swallowed by men's eyes, They surfeited with honey and began To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little More than a little is by much too much. So, when he had occasion to be seen, He was but as the cuckoo is in June, Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes As, sick and blunted with community, Afford no extraordinary gaze Such as is bent on sunlike majesty When it shines seldom in admiring eyes, But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down, Slept in his face, and rendered such aspect As cloudy men use to their adversaries, Being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full. And in that very line, Harry, standest thou, For thou has lost thy princely privilege With vile participation. Not an eye But is aweary of thy common sight, Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more, Which now doth that I would not have it do, Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

For of no right, nor color like to right, He doth fill fields with harness in the realm, Turns head against the lion's armed jaws, And, being no more in debt to years than thou, Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on To bloody battles and to bruising arms. What never-dying honor hath he got Against renowned Douglas, whose high deeds, Whose hot incursions and great name in arms, Holds from all soldiers chief majority And military title capital Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ. Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes, This infant warrior, in his enterprises Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once, Enlarged him, and made a friend of him, To fill the mouth of deep defiance up And shake the peace and safety of our throne. And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland, The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer, Capitulate against us and are up. But wherefore do I tell these news to thee? Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes, Which art my nearest and dearest enemy? Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear, Base inclination, and the start of spleen, To fight against me under Percy's pay, To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns, To show how much thou art degenerate.

And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights, That this same child of honor and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. For every honor sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head My shames redoubled! For the time will come That I shall make this northern youth exchange His glorious deeds for my indignities. Percy is but my factor, good my lord, To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf. And I will call him to so strict account That he shall render every glory up, Yea, even the slightest worship of his time, Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart. This in the name of God I promise here, The which if He be pleased I shall perform, I do beseech your Majesty may salve The long-grown wounds of my intemperance. If not, the end of life cancels all bands, And I will die a hundred thousand deaths Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

So hath the business that I come to speak of. Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word That Douglas and the English rebels met The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury. A mighty and a fearful head they are, If promises be kept on every hand, As ever offered foul play in the state.
 
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today, With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster, For this advertisement is five days old.- On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward. On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting Is Bridgenorth. And, Harry, you shall march Through Gloucestershire; by which account, Our business valued, some twelve days hence Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet. Our hands are full of business. Let's away. Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.

Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action? Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose gown. I am withered like an old applejohn. Well, I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking. I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse. The inside of a church! Company, villanous company, hath been the spoil of me.
 
Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.
 
Why, there is it. Come sing me a bawdy song, make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be, virtuous enough: swore little; diced not above seven times- a week; went to a bawdy house once in a quarter-of an hour; paid money that I borrowed, three or four times; lived well and in good compass; and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.
 
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
 
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life. Thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee. Thou art the knight of the burning lamp.
 
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 165 --%%--
 
No, I'll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death's-head or a <i>memento mori</i>. I never see thy face but I think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear by thy face. My oath should be "By this fire, that's God's angel." But thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an <i>ignis fatuus</i>, or a ball of wildfire, there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years, God reward me for it.
 
'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
 
Godamercy, so should I be sure to be heart-burned!
 
How now, Dame Partlet the hen, have you enquired yet who picked my pocket?
 
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John, do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched, I have enquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 167 --%%--
 
You lie, hostess. Bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go to, you are a woman, go.
 
Who, I? No; I defy thee! God's light, I was never called so in mine own house before.
 
Go to, I know you well enough.
 
No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.
 
Dowlas, filthy dowlas. I have given them away to bakers' wives; they have made bolters of them.
 
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by- drinkings, and money lent you, four and twenty pound.
 
<i>(points at</i> BARDOLPH<i>)</i> He had his part of it. Let him pay.
 
He? Alas, he is poor. He hath nothing.
 
How, poor? Look upon his face. What call you rich? Let them coin his nose. Let them coin his cheeks. I'll not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker of me? Shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a seal ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
 
O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was copper!

How? The Prince is a jack, a sneak-up. 'Sblood, an he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so.

Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
 
My lord, I pray you, hear me.
 
What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
 
Good my lord, hear me.
 
Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
 
What say'st thou, Jack?
 
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, and had my pocket picked. This house is turned bawdy house; they pick pockets.
 
What didst thou lose, Jack?
 
Wilt thou believe me, Hal, three or four bonds of forty pound apiece, and a seal ring of my grandfather's.
 
A trifle, some eightpenny matter.

So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so. And, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul- mouthed man as he is;,and said he would cudgel you.
 
What, he did not!
 
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
 
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.
 
Say, what thing, what thing?
 
What thing! Why, a thing to thank God on.
 
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it! I am an honest man's wife, and, setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.
 
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.
 
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
 
What beast? Why, an otter.
 
An otter, Sir John. Why an otter?
 
Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 173 --%%--
 
Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou.
 
Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly.
 
So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you owed him a thousand pound.
 
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
 
A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is worth a million; thou owest me thy love.
 
Nay, my lord, he called you "jack," and said he would cudgel you.
 
Did I, Bardolph?
 
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
 
Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
 
I say 'tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
 
Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare, but as thou art Prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of a lion's whelp.
 
And why not as the lion?
 
The King is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle break.

O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine. It is all filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy houses, and one poor pennyworth, of sugar candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And, yet you will stand to it! You will not pocket up wrong! Art thou not ashamed?
 
Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty. You confess, then, you picked my pocket?
 
It appears so by the story.
 
Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready breakfast, love thy, husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy guests. Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason. Thou seest I am pacified still. Nay, prithee, be gone.
 
Now, Hal, to the news at court. For the robbery, lad, how is that answered?
 
O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee. The money is paid back again.
 
O, I do not like that paying back. 'Tis a double labor.

I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find one that can steal well? O, for a fine thief of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these rebels. They offend none but the virtuous. I laud them; I praise them.
 
Bardolph!
 
My lord.
 
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
 
Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
 
Jack, meet me tomorrow in the Temple hall At two o'clock in the afternoon; There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive Money and order for their furniture. The land is burning. Percy stands on high, And either we or they must lower lie.

Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth In this fine age were not thought flattery, Such attribution should the Douglas have As not a soldier of this season's stamp Should go so general current through the world. By God, I cannot flatter. I do defy The tongues of soothers. But a braver place In my heart's love hath no man than yourself. Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
 
Thou art the king of honor. No man so potent breathes upon the ground But I will beard him.
 
Do so, and 'tis well.
 
What letters hast thou there? <i>(to</i> DOUGLAS<i>)</i> I can but thank you.
 
These letters come from your father.
 
Letters from him! Why comes he not himself?
 
He cannot come, my lord. He is grievous sick.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 183 --%%--
 
Zounds, how has he the leisure to be sick In such a justling time? Who leads his power? Under whose government come they along?
 
His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
 
I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
 
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth, And, at the time of my departure thence, He was much feared by his physicians.
 
I would the state of time had first been whole Ere he by sickness had been visited. His health was never better worth than now.
 
Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infect The very lifeblood of our enterprise. 'Tis catching hither, even to our camp. He writes me here that inward sickness- And that his friends by deputation Could not so soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet To lay so dangerous and dear a trust On any soul removed but on his own; Yet doth he give us bold advertisement That with our small conjunction we should on To see how fortune is disposed to us, For, as he writes, there is no quailing now, Because the King is certainly possessed Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
 
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
 
A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off! And yet, in faith, it is not. His present want Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good To set the exact wealth of all our states All at one cast? To set so rich a main On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour? It were not good, for therein should we read The very bottom and the soul of hope, The very list, the very utmost bound Of all our fortunes.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 185 --%%--
 
Faith, and so we should, where now remains A sweet reversion. We may boldly spend Upon the hope of what is to come in. A comfort of retirement lives in this.
 
A rendezvous, a home to fly unto, If that the devil and mischance look big Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
 
But yet I would your father had been here. The quality and hair of our attempt Brooks no division. It will be thought By some that know not why he is away That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence. And think how such an apprehension May turn the tide of fearful faction And breed a kind of question in our cause. For well you know, we of the off'ring side Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament, And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence The eye of reason may pry in upon us. This absence of your father's draws a curtain That shows the ignorant a kind of fear Before not dreamt of.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 187 --%%--
 
You strain too far. I rather of his absence make this use: It lends a luster and more great opinion, A larger dare, to our great enterprise Than if the Earl were here, for men must think If we without his help can make a head To push against a kingdom, with his help We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down. Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
 
As heart can think. There is not such a word Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
 
My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
 
Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord. The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong, Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John.
 
No harm, what more?
 
And further I have learned, The King himself in person is set forth, Or hitherwards intended speedily, With strong and mighty preparation.
 
He shall be welcome too. Where is his son, The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales, And his comrades, that daffed the world aside And bid it pass?

All furnished, all in arms, All plumed like estridges that with the wind Baited like eagles having lately bathed, Glittering in golden coats like images, As full of spirit as the month of May, And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer, Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls. I saw young Harry with his beaver on, His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armed Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury And vaulted with such ease into his seat As if an angel dropped down from the clouds, To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
 
No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come. They come like sacrifices in their trim, And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war All hot and bleeding will we offer them. The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse, Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales. Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse, Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse. O, that Glendower were come!
 
There is more news. I learned in Worcester, as I rode along, He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.

What may the King's whole battle reach unto?
 
To thirty thousand.
 
Forty let it be. My father and Glendower being both away, The powers of us may serve so great a day. Come, let us take a muster speedily. Doomsday is near. Die all, die merrily.
 
Talk not of dying. I am out of fear Of death or death's hand for this one half year.

Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry. Fill me a bottle of sack. Our soldiers shall march through. We'll to Sutton Coldfield tonight.
 
Will you give me money, captain?

This bottle makes an angel.
 
An if it do, take it for thy labor. An if it make twenty, take them all. I'll answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
 
I will, captain. Farewell.
 
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have misused the King's press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen's sons; inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves-as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads, and
 
--%%-- pageNum: 195 --%%--
 
they have bought out their services, and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies-slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded, unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers tradefallen, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable-ragged than an old feazed ancient; and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through Coventry with them, that's flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There's not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were there and you too, but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us all. We must away all night.
 
Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.
 
I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after?
 
Mine, Hal, mine.
 
I did never see such pitiful rascals.
 
Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder. They'll fill a pit as well as better. Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.

Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never learned that of me.

You do not counsel well. You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
 
Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life (And I dare well maintain it with my life), If well-respected honor bid me on, I hold as little counsel with weak fear As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives. Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle Which of us fears.

Your Uncle Worcester's horse came but today, And now their pride and mettle is asleep, Their courage with hard labor tame and dull, That not a horse is half the half of himself.
 
So are the horses of the enemy In general journey-bated and brought low. The better part of ours are full of rest.

I come with gracious offers from the King, If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
 
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God You were of our determination. Some of us love you well, and even those some Envy your great deservings and good name Because you are not of our quality But stand against us like an enemy.

And God defend but still I should stand so, So long as out of limit and true rule You stand against anointed majesty. But to my charge. The king hath sent to know The nature of your griefs, and whereupon You conjure from the breast of civil peace Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land Audacious cruelty. If that the king Have any way your good deserts forgot, Which he confesseth to be manifold, He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed You shall have your desires with interest And pardon absolute for yourself and these Herein misled by your suggestion.
 
The king is kind, and well we know the king Knows at what time to promise, when to pay. My father and my uncle and myself Did give him that same royalty he wears, And when he was not six-and-twenty strong, Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low, A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home, My father gave him welcome to the shore; And when he heard him swear and vow to God He came but to be Duke of Lancaster, To sue his livery, and beg his peace, With tears of innocency and terms of zeal, My father, in kind heart and pity moved, Swore him assistance and performed it too. Now when the lords and barons of the realm Perceived Northumberland did lean to him, The more and less came in with cap and knee, Met him in boroughs, cities, villages, Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes, Laid gifts before him, proffered him their oaths, Gave him their heirs as pages, followed him Even at the heels in golden multitudes. He presently, as greatness knows itself, Steps me a little higher than his vow Made to my father while his blood was poor Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh, And now forsooth takes on him to reform Some certain edicts and some strait decrees That lie too heavy on the commonwealth, Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep Over his country's wrongs, and by this face, This seeming brow of justice, did he win The hearts of all that he did angle for, Proceeded further-cut me off the heads Of all the favourites that the absent King In deputation left behind him here When he was personal in the Irish war.

Tut, I came not to hear this.
 
Then to the point. In short time after, he deposed the King, Soon after that deprived him of his life And, in the neck of that, tasked the whole state. To make that worse, suffered his kinsman March (Who is, if every owner were well placed, Indeed his king) to be engaged in Wales, There without ransom to lie forfeited, Disgraced me in my happy victories, Sought to entrap me by intelligence, Rated mine uncle from the council board, In rage dismissed my father from the court, Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong, And in conclusion drove us to seek out This head of safety, and withal to pry Into his title, the which we find Too indirect for long continuance.

My good lord, I guess their tenor.
 
Like enough you do. Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men Must bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury, As I am truly given to understand, The King with mighty and quick-raised power Meets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael, What with the sickness of Northumberland, Whose power was in the first proportion, And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence, Who with them was a rated sinew too And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies, I fear the power of Percy is too weak To wage an instant trial with the King.
 
Why, my good lord, you need not fear. There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
 
No, Mortimer is not there.
 
But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy, And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.

And so there is. But yet the King hath drawn The special head of all the land together: The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt, And many more corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms.
 
Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
 
I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear; And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed. For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King Dismiss his power, he means to visit us, For he hath heard of our confederacy, And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him: Therefore make haste. I must go write again To other friends. And so farewell, Sir Michael.

Then with the losers let it sympathize, For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
 
How now, my Lord of Worcester? 'Tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet. You have deceived our trust And made us doff our easy robes of peace To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel. This is not well, my lord; this is not well. What say you to it?

To this we swore our aid.

These things indeed you have articulate, Proclaimed at market crosses, read in churches, To face the garment of rebellion With some fine color that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents, Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation. And never yet did insurrection want Such water colors to impaint his cause, Nor moody beggars starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
 
In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,

The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes, This present enterprise set off his head, I do not think a braver gentleman, More active-valiant, or more valiant-young, More daring or more bold, is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds. For my part, I may speak it to my shame, I have a truant been to chivalry, And so I hear he doth account me too. Yet this before my father's majesty: I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation, And will, to save the blood on either side, Try fortune with him in a single fight.
 
And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee, Albeit considerations infinite Do make against it.-No, good Worcester, no, We love our people well, even those we love That are misled upon your cousin's part. And, will they take the offer of our grace, Both he and they and you, yea, every man Shall be my friend again, and I'll be his. So tell your cousin, and bring me word What he will do. But if he will not yield, Rebuke and dread correction wait on us, And they shall do their office. So begone. We will not now be troubled with reply. We offer fair. Take it advisedly.
 
It will not be accepted, on my life. The Douglas and the Hotspur both together Are confident against the world in arms.

Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge, For on their answer will we set on them, And God befriend us as our cause is just.
 
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
 
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship. Say thy prayers, and farewell.
 
I would 'twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.
 
Why, thou owest God a death.
 
'Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay Him before His day. What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter. Honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a leg? no. Or an arm? no. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery, then? No. What is honor? A word. What is in that word "honor"? What is that "honor"? Air. A trim reckoning. Who hath it? He that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. 'Tis insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore, I'll none of it. Honor is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism.

O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard, The liberal and kind offer of the King.
 
'Twere best he did.
 
Then are we all undone. It is not possible, it cannot be The King should keep his word in loving us. He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offense in other faults. Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes, For treason is but trusted like the fox, Who, never so tame, so cherished and locked up, Will have a wild trick of his ancestors. Look how we can, or sad or merrily, Interpretation will misquote our looks, And we shall feed like oxen at a stall, The better cherished still the nearer death. My nephew's trespass may be well forgot; It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood, And an adopted name of privilege- A hairbrained Hotspur governed by a spleen: All his offenses live upon my head And on his father's. We did train him on, And, his corruption being ta'en from us, We as the spring of all shall pay for all. Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know In any case the offer of the King.

My uncle is returned. Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.- Uncle, what news?
 
The King will bid you battle presently.
 
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
 
Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
 
Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
 
There is no seeming mercy in the King.
 
Did you beg any? God forbid!
 
I told him gently of our grievances, Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus By now forswearing that he is forsworn. He calls us "rebels," "traitors," and will scourge With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
 
Arm, gentlemen, to arms. For I have thrown A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth, And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it, Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
 
The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King, And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.

O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads, And that no man might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me, How showed his tasking? Seemed it in contempt?
 
No, by my soul. I never in my life Did hear a challenge urged more modestly, Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms. He gave you all the duties of a man, Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue, Spoke your deservings like a chronicle, Making you ever better than his praise By still dispraising praise valued in you, And, which became him like a prince indeed, He made a blushing cital of himself, And chid his truant youth with such a grace As if he mastered there a double spirit Of teaching and of learning instantly. There did he pause: but let me tell the world: If he outlive the envy of this day, England did never owe so sweet a hope, So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
 
Cousin, I think thou art enamored On his follies. Never did I hear Of any Prince so wild a liberty. But be he as he will, yet once ere night I will embrace him with a soldier's arm, That he shall shrink under my courtesy.- Arm, arm with speed, and, fellows, soldiers, friends, Better consider what you have to do Than I that have not well the gift of tongue Can lift your blood up with persuasion.

My lord, here are letters for you.
 
I cannot read them now.- O gentlemen, the time of life is short; To spend that shortness basely were too long If life did ride upon a dial's point, Still ending at the arrival of an hour. An if we live, we live to tread on kings; If die, brave death, when princes die with us. Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair When the intent of bearing them is just.
 
My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.
 
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale, For I profess not talking. Only this: Let each man do his best. And here draw I a sword, Whose temper I intend to stain With the best blood that I can meet withal In the adventure of this perilous day. Now, Esperance! Percy! And set on. Sound all the lofty instruments of war, And by that music let us all embrace, For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall A second time do such a courtesy.

What is thy name that in the battle thus Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek Upon my head?
 
Know then, my name is Douglas, And I do haunt thee in the battle thus Because some tell me that thou art a king.
 
They tell thee true.
 
The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry, This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee, Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
 
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot, And thou shalt find a king that will revenge Lord Stafford's death.
 
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus, I never had triumphed upon a Scot.
 
All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the King.

Here.
 
This, Douglas? No, I know this face full well. A gallant knight he was; his name was Blunt, Semblably furnished like the King himself.
 
<i>(to</i> BLUNT<i>)</i> A fool go with thy soul whither it goes! A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear. Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
 
The King hath many marching in his coats.
 
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats. I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece, Until I meet the King.
 
Up and away! Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
 
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot here. Here's no scoring but upon the pate.-Soft, who are you? Sir Walter Blunt. There's honor for you. Here's no vanity. I am as hot as molten lead, and as heavy too. God keep lead out of me; I need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered. There's not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and they are for the town's end, to beg during life. But who comes here?

What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword. Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies, Whose deaths are yet unrevenged. I prithee, Lend me thy sword.
 
O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid Percy; I have made him sure.
 
He is indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee, lend me thy sword.
 
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou gett'st not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
 
Give it to me. What, is it in the case?
 
Ay, Hal, 'tis hot, 'tis hot. There's that will sack a city.<i> (</i> PRINCE HENRY<i> draws it out and finds it to be a bottle of sack)</i>
 
What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
 
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do come in my way, so; if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like not such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath. Give me life, which if I can save, so: if not, honor comes unlooked for, and there's an end.

I will do so.-My Lord of Westmoreland, Lead him to his tent.
 
Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
 
Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help, And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive The Prince of Wales from such a field as this, Where stained nobility lies trodden on, And rebels' arms triumph in massacres.
 
We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland, Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come.

The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart, So many of his shadows thou hast met And not the very king. I have two boys Seek Percy and thyself about the field, But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily, I will assay thee. And defend thyself.
 
I fear thou art another counterfeit, And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king. But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be, And thus I win thee.

O God, they did me too much injury That ever said I hearkened for your death. If it were so, I might have let alone The insulting hand of Douglas over you, Which would have been as speedy in your end As all the poisonous potions in the world, And saved the treacherous labor of your son.
 
Make up to Clifton. I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
 
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
 
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
 
My name is Harry Percy.
 
Why, then I see A very valiant rebel of the name. I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy, To share with me in glory any more. Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere, Nor can one England brook a double reign, Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

I can no longer brook thy vanities.
 
Well said, Hal! To it Hal! Nay, you shall find no boys' play here, I can tell you.
 
O Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth. I better brook the loss of brittle life Than those proud titles thou hast won of me. They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh. But thoughts, the slave of life, and life, time's fool, And time, that takes survey of all the world, Must have a stop.

For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart. Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk! When that this body did contain a spirit, A kingdom for it was too small a bound, But now two paces of the vilest earth Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead Bears not alive so stout a gentleman. If thou wert sensible of courtesy, I should not make so dear a show of zeal. But let my favors hide thy mangled face; And even in thy behalf I'll thank myself For doing these fair rites of tenderness. Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven. Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave, But not remembered in thy epitaph.
 
What, old acquaintance, could not all this flesh Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell. I could have better spared a better man. O, I should have a heavy miss of thee If I were much in love with vanity. Death hath not struck so fat a deer today, Though many dearer in this bloody fray. Emboweled will I see thee by and by; Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.

to counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I lie. I am no counterfeit. To die is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man; but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed. The better part of valor is discretion, in the which better part I have saved my life. Zounds, I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead. How if he should counterfeit too and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I'll make him sure, yea, and I'll swear I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore, sirrah, <i>(stabs the body)</i> with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me. <i>(he takes up</i> HOTSPUR <i>on his back)</i>
 
Come, brother John. Full bravely hast thou fleshed Thy maiden sword.
 
But soft, whom have we here? Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
 
I did; I saw him dead, Breathless and bleeding on the ground.-Art thou alive? Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight? I prithee, speak. We will not trust our eyes Without our ears. Thou art not what thou seem'st.
 
No, that's certain. I am not a double man. But if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a jack. There is Percy. If your father will do me any honor,so; if not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.

Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying. I grant you, Iwas down and out of breath, and so was he, but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be believed, so; if not, let them that should reward valor bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh. If the man were alive and would deny it, zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
 
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
 
This is the strangest fellow, brother John.- Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back. For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
 
The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours. Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field To see what friends are living, who are dead.

How goes the field?
 
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw The fortune of the day quite turned from him, The noble Percy slain, and all his men Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest, And, falling from a hill, he was so bruised That the pursuers took him.

Then this remains, that we divide our power. You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland, Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop, Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.

Noble Earl, I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
 
Good, an God will!
 
As good as heart can wish. The King is almost wounded to the death, And, in the fortune of my lord your son, Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts Killed by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field; And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John, Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day, So fought, so followed, and so fairly won, Came not till now to dignify the times Since Caesar's fortunes.
 
How is this derived? Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?
 
I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence, A gentleman well bred and of good name, That freely rendered me these news for true.
 
Here comes my servant Travers, who I sent On Tuesday last to listen after news.
 
My lord, I overrode him on the way; And he is furnished with no certainties More than he haply may retail from me.
 
Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 273 --%%--
 
My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turned me back With joyful tidings and, being better horsed, Outrode me. After him came spurring hard A gentleman, almost forspent with speed, That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse. He asked the way to Chester, and of him I did demand what news from Shrewsbury. He told me that rebellion had bad luck And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold. With that he gave his able horse the head And, bending forward, struck his armed heels Against the panting sides of his poor jade Up to the rowel-head, and starting so He seemed in running to devour the way, Staying no longer question.
 
Ha? Again: Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold? Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion Had met ill luck?
 
My lord, I'll tell you what: If my young lord your son have not the day, Upon mine honor, for a silken point I'll give my barony. Never talk of it.
 
Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss?
 
Who, he? He was some hilding fellow that had stolen The horse he rode on and, upon my life, Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.

Yea, this man's brow, like to a title leaf, Foretells the nature of a tragic volume. So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness'd usurpation.- Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
 
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord, Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our party.
 
How doth my son and brother? Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand. Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless, So dull, so dead in look, so woebegone, Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night, And would have told him half his Troy was burnt; But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it. This thou wouldst say, "Your son did thus and thus; Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas"- Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds. But in the end, to stop my ear indeed, Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, Ending with "Brother, son, and all are dead."
 
Douglas is living, and your brother yet, But for my lord your son-
 
Why, he is dead. See what a ready tongue suspicion hath! He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath, by instinct, knowledge from others' eyes That what he feared is chanced. Yet speak, Morton. Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 277 --%%--
 
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
 
You are too great to be by me gainsaid, Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
 
Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead. I see a strange confession in thine eye. Thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so. The tongue offends not that reports his death; And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, Not he which says the dead is not alive. Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office, and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell Remembered tolling a departing friend.
 
I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
 
I am sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen, But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, Rend'ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed, To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down The never-daunted Percy to the earth, From whence with life he never more sprung up. In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp, Being bruited once, took fire and heat away From the best tempered courage in his troops; For from his metal was his party steeled, Which, once in him abated, all the rest Turned on themselves, like dull and heavy lead. And as the thing that's heavy in itself Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,

So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss, Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety, Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot, The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword Had three times slain th'appearance of the King, Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame Of those that turned their backs and in his flight, Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all Is that the King hath won and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you, my lord, Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
 
For this I shall have time enough to mourn. In poison there is physic, and these news, Having been well, that would have made me sick, Being sick, have in some measure made me well. And as the wretch whose fever-weakened joints, Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life, Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs, Weakened with grief, being now enraged with grief, Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou nice crutch. A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand. And hence, thou sickly coif. Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes, fleshed with conquest, aim to hit. Now bind my brows with iron, and approach The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon th'enraged Northumberland. Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature's hand Keep the wild flood confined. Let order die, And let this world no longer be a stage

This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
 
Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor. The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health, the which, if you give o'er To stormy passion, must perforce decay. You cast th' event of war, my noble lord, And summed the account of chance before you said "Let us make head." It was your presurmise That, in the dole of blows your son might drop. You knew he walked o'er perils on an edge, More likely to fall in than to get o'er. You were advised his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged. Yet did you say "Go forth," and none of this, Though strongly apprehended, could restrain The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall'n, Or what did this bold enterprise brought forth, More than that being which was like to be?
 
We all that are engaged to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life, 'twas ten to one; And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed Choked the respect of likely peril feared;

And since we are o'erset, venture again. Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
 
'Tis more than time.-And, my most noble lord, I hear for certain, and do speak the truth: The gentle Archbishop of York is up With well-appointed powers. He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers. My lord your son had only but the corpse, But shadows and the shows of men, to fight; For that same word "rebellion" did divide The action of their bodies from their souls, And they did fight with queasiness, constrained, As men drink potions, that their weapons only Seemed on our side. But, for their spirits and souls, This word "rebellion," it had froze them up As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop Turns insurrection to religion. Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts, He's followed both with body and with mind, And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones; Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause; Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land, Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke; And more and less do flock to follow him.
 
I knew of this before, but, to speak truth, This present grief had wiped it from my mind. Go in with me and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge. Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed. Never so few, and never yet more need.

He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but, for the party that owed it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.
 
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than I invent, or is invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never manned with an agate till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel. The juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge-I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when He will. 'Tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it, and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor.

He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours. He liked not the security.
 
Let him be damned like the glutton! Pray God his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel, a rascally yea-forsooth knave, to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security! The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with "security." I looked he should have sent me two-and-twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me "security." Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it, and yet cannot he see though he have his own lantern to light him. Where's Bardolph?
 
He's gone into Smithfield to buy your Worship a horse.
 
I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.

Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
 
Wait close. I will not see him.
 
What's he that goes there?
 
Falstaff, an 't please your Lordship.
 
He that was in question for the robbery?
 
He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.
 
What, to York? Call him back again.
 
Sir John Falstaff!
 
Boy, tell him I am deaf.
 
You must speak louder. My master is deaf.
 
I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.-Go pluck him by the elbow. I must speak with him.
 
Sir John!
 
What, a young knave and begging? Is there not wars? Is there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the

worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.
 
You mistake me, sir.
 
Why sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.
 
I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you, you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man.
 
I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which grows to me? If thou gett'st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak'st leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt counter. Hence! Avaunt!
 
Sir, my lord would speak with you.
 
Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
 
My good lord. God give your Lordship good time of the day. I am glad to see your Lordship abroad. I heard say your Lordship was sick: I hope your Lordship goes abroad by advice. Your Lordship, though not clean past your youth, have yet some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech your Lordship to have a reverent care of your health.
 
Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.
 
An 't please your Lordship, I hear his Majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 293 --%%--
 
I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.
 
And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy.
 
Well, God mend him. I pray you let me speak with you.
 
This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an 't please your Lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.
 
What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.
 
It hath its original from much grief, from study, and perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen. It is a kind of deafness.
 
I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.
 
Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, an 't please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
 
To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.
 
I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your Lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty, but how should I be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.

I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.
 
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.
 
Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
 
He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
 
Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
 
I would it were otherwise. I would my means were greater and my waist slender.
 
You have misled the youthful Prince.
 
The young Prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.
 
Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound. Your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit on <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="tooltip-link"><span class="tooltip-css tooltip-background"><h4 class="semi-bold">Gad's Hill</h4><p>The robbery at Gad's Hill occurs in Henry IV, Part One.</p></span>Gad's Hill</a>. You may thank th' unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting that action.
 
My lord.
 
But since all is well, keep it so. Wake not a sleeping wolf.

To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
 
What, you are as a candle, the better part burnt out.
 
A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow. If I did say of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
 
There is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravity.
 
His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
 
You follow the young Prince up and down like his ill angel.
 
Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers' times that true valor is turned bear-herd; pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings. All the other gifts appurtenant to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young. You do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls, and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.
 
Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard,

a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John.
 
My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding. And he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have checked him for it, and the young lion repents. Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.
 
Well, God send the Prince a better companion.
 
God send the companion a better prince. I cannot rid my hands of him.
 
Well, the King hath severed you and Prince Harry. I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.
 
Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day, for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever.

But it was always yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.
 
Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your expedition!
 
Will your Lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth?
 
Not a penny, not a penny. You are too impatient to bear crosses. Fare you well. Commend me to my cousin Westmoreland.
 
If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery; but the gout galls the one, and the pox pinches the other, and so both the degrees prevent my curses.-Boy!
 
Sir.
 
What money is in my purse?
 
Seven groats and two pence.
 
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse. Borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair on my chin. About it. You know where to find me.

Thus have you heard our cause and known our means, And, my most noble friends, I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes. And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
 
I well allow the occasion of our arms, But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King.
 
Our present musters grow upon the file To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice, And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuries.
 
The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus: Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland.
 
With him we may.
 
Yea, marry, there's the point. But if without him we be thought too feeble, My judgment is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand. For in a theme so bloody-faced as this, Conjecture, expectation, and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 307 --%%--
 
'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed It was young Hotspur's cause at Shrewsbury.
 
It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope, Eating the air on promise of supply, Flatt'ring himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts, And so, with great imagination Proper to madmen, led his powers to death And, winking, leapt into destruction.
 
But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
 
Yes, if this present quality of war- Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot- Lives so in hope, as in an early spring We see the appearing buds, which to prove fruit Hope gives not so much warrant as despair That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build, We first survey the plot, then draw the model, And when we see the figure of the house, Then must we rate the cost of the erection, Which if we find outweighs ability, What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices, or at last desist To build at all? Much more in this great work, Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down And set another up, should we survey The plot of situation and the model, Consent upon a sure foundation, Question surveyors, know our own estate, How able such a work to undergo, To weigh against his opposite. Or else
 
--%%-- pageNum: 309 --%%--
 
We fortify in paper and in figures, Using the names of men instead of men, Like one that draws the model of a house Beyond his power to build it, who, half through, Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost A naked subject to the weeping clouds And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
 
Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth, Should be stillborn and that we now possessed The utmost man of expectation, I think we are a body strong enough, Even as we are, to equal with the King.
 
What, is the King but five-and twenty-thousand?
 
To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph, For his divisions, as the times do brawl, Are in three heads: one power against the French, And one against Glendower; perforce a third Must take up us. So is the unfirm King In three divided, and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptiness.
 
That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreaded.
 
If he should do so, He leaves his back unarmed, the French and Welsh Baying him at the heels. Never fear that.
 
Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 311 --%%--
 
The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland; Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth; But who is substituted against the French I have no certain notice.
 
Let us on, And publish the occasion of our arms. The commonwealth is sick of their own choice. Their over-greedy love hath surfeited. An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart. O thou fond many, with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke Before he was what thou wouldst have him be. And being now trimmed in thine own desires, Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up. So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard, And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times? They that, when Richard lived, would have him die Are now become enamored on his grave. Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke, Criest now "O earth, yield us that King again, And take thou this!" O thoughts of men accursed! Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.

He comes continuantly to Pie Corner, saving your manhoods, to buy a saddle, and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber's Head in Lumbert Street, to Master Smooth's the silkman. I pray you, since my exion is entered, and my case so openly known to the world, let him be brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed off from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he comes, and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph, with him. Do your offices, do your offices, Master Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.

I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up.

<i>(to</i> MISTRESS QUICKLY<i>)</i> What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
 
Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too.

Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me Gossip Quickly, coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone downstairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with

Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practiced upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.
 
Yea, in truth, my lord.
 
Pray thee, peace.- <i>(to</i> FALSTAFF<i>)</i> Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villany you have done her. The one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.
 
My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honorable boldness "impudent sauciness." If a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King's affairs.

Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.
 
Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast-with these, and those that were thy peach-colored ones-or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as, one for superfluity and another for use. But that the tennis-court keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland; and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit His kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened.

Delivered with good respect. And how doth the Martlemas your master?

<i>(reads)</i> <i>John Falstaff, knight.</i> Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself, even like those that are kin to the King, for they never prick their finger but they say, "There's some of the King's blood spilt." "How comes that?" says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap: "I am the King's poor cousin, sir."
 
Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it from Japheth. But to the letter. <i>(takes the letter and reads)</i> <i>Sir John alstaff, knight, to the son of the King nearest his father, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting.</i>

My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
 
That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you use me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister?
 
God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
 
Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us. <i>(to</i> BARDOLPH<i>)</i> Is your master here in London?
 
Yea, my lord.
 
Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
 
At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
 
What company?
 
Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
 
Sup any women with him?
 
None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet.

I am your shadow, my lord. I'll follow you.
 
Sirrah-you, boy-and Bardolph, no word to your master that I am yet come to town. <i>(gives them money)</i> There's for your silence.

Alas, sweet wife, my honor is at pawn, And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
 
O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars. The time was, father, that you broke your word, When you were more endeared to it than now, When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry, Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain. Who then persuaded you to stay at home? There were two honors lost, yours and your son's. For yours, the God of heaven brighten it. For his, it stuck upon him as the sun In the gray vault of heaven, and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves. He had no legs that practiced not his gait; And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish, Became the accents of the valiant; For those that could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse

To seem like him. So that in speech, in gait, In diet, in affections of delight, In military rules, humors of blood, He was the mark and glass, copy and book, That fashioned others. And him-O wondrous him! O miracle of men!-him did you leave, Second to none, unseconded by you, To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage, to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name Did seem defensible. So you left him. Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong To hold your honor more precise and nice With others than with him. Let them alone. The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong. Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers, Today might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck, Have talked of Monmouth's grave.
 
Beshrew your heart, Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights. But I must go and meet with danger there, Or it will seek me in another place And find me worse provided.
 
Oh, fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little taste.
 
If they get ground and vantage of the King, Then join you with them like a rib of steel To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves, First let them try themselves. So did your son; He was so suffered. So came I a widow, And never shall have length of life enough

He must then to the Inns o' Court shortly. I was once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.
 
You were called "Lusty Shallow" then, cousin.
 
By the Mass, I was called anything, and I would have done anything indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold man. You had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the Inns o' Court

again. And I may say to you, we knew where the bona robas were and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
 
This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
 
The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break Scoggin's head at the court gate, when he was a crack not thus high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Grey's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I have spent! And to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead.
 
We shall all follow, cousin.
 
Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure. Death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all. All shall die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford Fair?
 
By my troth, cousin, I was not there.
 
Death is certain. Is old Dooble of your town living yet?
 
Dead, sir.
 
Jesu, Jesu, dead! He drew a good bow, and dead? He shot a fine shoot. John o' Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on his head. Dead! He would have clapped i' th' clout at twelve score, and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half, that it would have done a man's heart good to see. How a score of ewes now?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 397 --%%--
 
Thereafter as they be, a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds.
 
And is old Dooble dead?
 
Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.
 
Good morrow, honest gentlemen.
 
I beseech you, which is Justice Shallow?
 
I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county and one of the King's justices of the peace. What is your good pleasure with me?
 
My captain, sir, commends him to you, my captain, Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most gallant leader.
 
He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword man. How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?
 
Sir, pardon. A soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.
 
It is well said, in faith, sir, and it is well said indeed too. "Better accommodated." It is good, yea, indeed, is it. Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 399 --%%--
 
"Accommodated." It comes of <i>accommodo</i>. Very good, a good phrase.
 
Pardon, sir; I have heard the word-"phrase" call you it? By this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldierlike word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. "Accommodated," that is when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be accommodated, which is an excellent thing.
 
It is very just. Look, here comes good Sir John.-Give me your good hand, give me your Worship's good hand. By my troth, you like well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good Sir John.
 
I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow.- Master Sure-card, as I think?
 
No, Sir John. It is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.
 
Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the peace.
 
Your good Worship is welcome.
 
Fie, this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
 
Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 401 --%%--
 
Let me see them, I beseech you.
 
Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so, so. So, so. Yea, marry, sir.-Rafe Mouldy!-Let them appear as I call, let them do so, let them do so. Let me see, where is Mouldy?
 
Here, an it please you.
 
What think you, Sir John? A good-limbed fellow; young, strong, and of good friends.
 
Is thy name Mouldy?
 
Yea, an 't please you.
 
'Tis the more time thou wert used.
 
Ha, ha, ha, most excellent, i' faith! Things that are mouldy lack use. Very singular good, in faith. Well said, Sir John, very well said.
 
Prick him.
 
I was pricked well enough before, an you could have let me alone. My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery. You need not to have pricked me. There are other men fitter to go out than I.
 
Go to. Peace, Mouldy. You shall go. Mouldy, it is time you were spent.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 403 --%%--
 
Spent?
 
Peace, fellow, peace. Stand aside. Know you where you are?-For th' other, Sir John. Let me see.-Simon Shadow!
 
Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under. He's like to be a cold soldier.
 
Where's Shadow?
 
Here, sir.
 
Shadow, whose son art thou?
 
My mother's son, sir.
 
Thy mother's son! Like enough, and thy father's shadow. So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is often so, indeed, but much of the father's substance.
 
Do you like him, Sir John?
 
Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him, for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster book.
 
Thomas Wart!
 
Where's he?
 
Here, sir.
 
Is thy name Wart?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 405 --%%--
 
Yea, sir.
 
Thou art a very ragged wart.
 
Shall I prick him down, Sir John?
 
It were superfluous, for his apparel is built upon his back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more.
 
Ha, ha, ha. You can do it, sir, you can do it. I commend you well.-Francis Feeble!
 
Here, sir.
 
What trade art thou, Feeble?
 
A woman's tailor, sir.
 
Shall I prick him, sir?
 
You may, but if he had been a man's tailor, he'd ha' pricked you.-Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
 
I will do my good will, sir. You can have no more.
 
Well said, good woman's tailor, well said, courageous Feeble. Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse.-Prick the woman's tailor well, Master Shallow, deep, Master Shallow.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 407 --%%--
 
I would Wart might have gone, sir.
 
I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
 
It shall suffice, sir.
 
I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble.-Who is next?
 
Peter Bullcalf o' th' green.
 
Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.
 
Here, sir.
 
Fore God, a likely fellow. Come, prick me Bullcalf till he roar again.
 
O Lord, good my lord captain-
 
What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?
 
O Lord, sir, I am a diseased man.
 
What disease hast thou?
 
A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with ringing in the King's affairs upon his coronation day, sir.
 
Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We will have away thy cold, and I will take such order that my friends shall ring for thee.- <i>(to</i> SHALLOW<i>)</i> Is here all?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 409 --%%--
 
Here is two more called than your number. You must have but four here, sir, and so I pray you go in with me to dinner.
 
Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
 
O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George's Field?
 
No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.
 
Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
 
She lives, Master Shallow.
 
She never could away with me.
 
Never, never; she would always say she could not abide Master Shallow.
 
By the Mass, I could anger her to th' heart. She was then a bona roba. Doth she hold her own well?
 
Old, old, Master Shallow.
 
Nay, she must be old. She cannot choose but be old. Certain, she's old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.
 
That's fifty-five year ago.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 411 --%%--
 
Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen!-Ha, Sir John, said I well?
 
We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
 
That we have, that we have, that we have. In faith, Sir John, we have. Our watchword was "Hem, boys." Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.
 
Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend, and here's four Harry ten-shillings in French crowns for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hanged, sir, as go. And yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care, but rather because I am unwilling, and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my friends. Else, sir, I did not care, for mine own part, so much.
 
Go to. Stand aside.
 
And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's sake, stand my friend. She has nobody to do anything about her when I am gone, and she is old and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.
 
Go to. Stand aside.
 
By my troth, I care not. A man can die but once. We owe God a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind. An 't be my destiny, so; an 't be not, so. No man's too good to serve 's prince, and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 413 --%%--
 
Well said. Th' art a good fellow.
 
Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
 
Come, sir, which men shall I have?
 
Four of which you please.
 
Sir, a word with you. <i>(aside to</i> FALSTAFF<i>)</i> I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.
 
Go to, well.
 
Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
 
Do you choose for me.
 
Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.
 
Mouldy and Bullcalf! For you, Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service.-And for your part, Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it. I will none of you.
 
Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
 
Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man? Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart. You see what a ragged appearance it is. He shall
 
--%%-- pageNum: 415 --%%--
 
charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy. The foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor, run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones.-Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.
 
Hold, Wart. Traverse. Thas, thas, thas.
 
Come, manage me your caliver: so, very well, go to, very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a little, lean, old, chopped, bald shot. Well said, i' faith, Wart. Th' art a good scab. Hold, there's a tester for thee.
 
He is not his craft's master. He doth not do it right. I remember at Mile End Green, when I lay at Clement's Inn- I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show-there was a little quiver fellow, and he would manage you his piece thus. And he would about and about, and come you in, and come you in. "Rah, tah, tah," would he say. "Bounce," would he say, and away again would he go, and again would he come. I shall ne'er see such a fellow.
 
These fellows will do well, Master Shallow.-God keep you, Master Silence. I will not use many words with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both. I thank you. I must a dozen mile to-night.-Bardolph, give the soldiers coats.
 
Sir John, the Lord bless you. God prosper your affairs. God send us peace. At your return, visit our house. Let our old
 
--%%-- pageNum: 417 --%%--
 
acquaintance be renewed. Peradventure I will with you to the court.
 
Fore God, would you would, Master Shallow.
 
Go to. I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
 
Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.
 
On, Bardolph. Lead the men away.
 
As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying. This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese paring. When he was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. He was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible. He was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores called him "mandrake." He came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and swore they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John o' Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I'll be sworn he ne'er saw him but once in the
 
--%%-- pageNum: 419 --%%--
 
tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the Marshal's men. I saw it and told John o' Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a court. And now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll be acquainted with him, if I return, and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

What is this forest called?
 
'Tis Gaultree Forest, an 't shall please your Grace.
 
Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth To know the numbers of our enemies.
 
We have sent forth already.
 
'Tis well done. My friends and brethren in these great affairs, I must acquaint you that I have received New-dated letters from Northumberland, Their cold intent, tenor, and substance, thus: Here doth he wish his person, with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality, The which he could not levy; whereupon He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes, To Scotland, and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful melting of their opposite.
 
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to pieces.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 423 --%%--
 
Now, what news?
 
West of this forest, scarcely off a mile, In goodly form comes on the enemy, And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
 
The just proportion that we gave them out. Let us sway on and face them in the field.
 
What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
 
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
 
Health and fair greeting from our general, The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
 
Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace, What doth concern your coming.
 
Then, my lord, Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech. If that rebellion Came like itself, in base and abject routs, Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage, And countenanced by boys and beggary- I say, if damn'd commotion so appeared In his true, native, and most proper shape, You, reverend father, and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection
 
--%%-- pageNum: 425 --%%--
 
With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop, Whose see is by a civil peace maintained, Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touched, Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutored, Whose white investments figure innocence, The dove and very blessed spirit of peace, Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace, Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war, Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood, Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine To a trumpet and a point of war?
 
Wherefore do I this? So the question stands. Briefly, to this end: we are all diseased, And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever, And we must bleed for it; of which disease Our late King Richard, being infected, died. But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland, I take not on me here as a physician, Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men, But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly. I have in equal balance justly weighed What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer, And find our griefs heavier than our offenses. We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforced from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion, And have the summary of all our griefs, When time shall serve, to show in articles; Which long ere this we offered to the King
 
--%%-- pageNum: 427 --%%--
 
And might by no suit gain our audience. When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs, We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong. The dangers of the days but newly gone, Whose memory is written on the earth With yet appearing blood, and the examples Of every minute's instance, present now, Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms, Not to break peace or any branch of it, But to establish here a peace indeed, Concurring both in name and quality.
 
When ever yet was your appeal denied? Wherein have you been galled by the King? What peer hath been suborned to grate on you, That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
 
My brother general, the commonwealth, To brother born an household cruelty, I make my quarrel in particular.
 
There is no need of any such redress, Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
 
Why not to him in part, and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honors?
 
O, my good Lord Mowbray, Construe the times to their necessities,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 429 --%%--
 
And you shall say indeed it is the time, And not the King, that doth you injuries. Yet for your part, it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on. Were you not restored To all the Duke of Norfolk's seigniories, Your noble and right well remembered father's?
 
What thing, in honor, had my father lost, That need to be revived and breathed in me? The King that loved him, as the state stood then, Was force perforce compelled to banish him, And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he, Being mounted and both roused in their seats, Their neighing coursers daring of the spur, Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down, Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together, Then, then, when there was nothing could have stayed My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, O, when the King did throw his warder down- His own life hung upon the staff he threw- Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
 
You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what. The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman. Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled? But if your father had been victor there, He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry; For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
 
--%%-- pageNum: 431 --%%--
 
Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on And blessed and graced, indeed more than the King. But this is mere digression from my purpose. Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience; and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just, You shall enjoy them, everything set off That might so much as think you enemies.
 
But he hath forced us to compel this offer; And it proceeds from policy, not love.
 
Mowbray, you overween to take it so. This offer comes from mercy, not from fear. For, lo, within a ken our army lies, Upon mine honor, all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear. Our battle is more full of names than yours, Our men more perfect in the use of arms, Our armor all as strong, our cause the best. Then reason will our hearts should be as good. Say you not then our offer is compelled.
 
Well, by my will, we shall admit no parley.
 
That argues but the shame of your offense. A rotten case abides no handling.
 
Hath the Prince John a full commission, In very ample virtue of his father, To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 433 --%%--
 
That is intended in the General's name. I muse you make so slight a question.
 
Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule, For this contains our general grievances. Each several article herein redressed, All members of our cause, both here and hence, That are insinewed to this action, Acquitted by a true substantial form And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confined, We come within our awful banks again And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
 
This will I show the General. Please you, lords, In sight of both our battles we may meet, And either end in peace, which God so frame, Or to the place of difference call the swords Which must decide it.
 
My lord, we will do so.
 
There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand.
 
Fear you not that. If we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon, Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
 
Yea, but our valuation shall be such That every slight and false-derived cause, Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason, Shall to the King taste of this action,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 435 --%%--
 
That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love, We shall be winnowed with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partition.
 
No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances, For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life; And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no telltale to his memory That may repeat and history his loss To new remembrance. For full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion; His foes are so enrooted with his friends That, plucking to unfix an enemy, He doth unfasten so and shake a friend; So that this land, like an offensive wife That hath enraged him on to offer strokes, As he is striking holds his infant up And hangs resolved correction in the arm That was upreared to execution.
 
Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods On late offenders, that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement, So that his power, like to a fangless lion, May offer but not hold.
 
'Tis very true, And therefore be assured, my good Lord Marshal, If we do now make our atonement well, Our peace will, like a broken limb united, Grow stronger for the breaking.

Be it so. Here is returned my Lord of Westmoreland.

Before, and greet his Grace.-<i>(to</i> WESTMORELAND<i>)</i> My lord, we come.
 
You are well encountered here, my cousin Mowbray.- Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,- And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.- My Lord of York, it better showed with you When that your flock, assembled by the bell, Encircled you to hear with reverence Your exposition on the holy text Than now to see you here, an iron man talking, Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum, Turning the word to sword, and life to death. That man that sits within a monarch's heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favor, Would he abuse the countenance of the King, Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 439 --%%--
 
It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken How deep you were within the books of God, To us the speaker in His parliament, To us th' imagined voice of God himself, The very opener and intelligencer Between the grace, the sanctities, of heaven, And our dull workings? O, who shall believe But you misuse the reverence of your place, Employ the countenance and grace of heaven As a false favorite doth his prince's name, In deeds dishonorable? You have ta'en up, Under the counterfeited zeal of God, The subjects of His substitute, my father, And both against the peace of heaven and him Have here up-swarmed them.
 
Good my Lord of Lancaster, I am not here against your father's peace, But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland, The time misordered doth, in common sense, Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace The parcels and particulars of our grief, The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court, Whereon this Hydra son of war is born, Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep With grant of our most just and right desires, And true obedience, of this madness cured, Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
 
If not, we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man.
 
And though we here fall down, We have supplies to second our attempt; If they miscarry, theirs shall second them,

And so success of mischief shall be born, And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up Whiles England shall have generation.
 
You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow To sound the bottom of the after-times.
 
Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles.
 
I like them all, and do allow them well, And swear here by the honor of my blood, My father's purposes have been mistook, And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority.  <i>(to</i> ARCHBISHOP<i>)</i> My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redressed; Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you, Discharge your powers unto their several counties, As we will ours, and here, between the armies, Let's drink together friendly and embrace, That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restored love and amity.
 
I take your princely word for these redresses.
 
I give it you, and will maintain my word, And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.
 
Go, captain, and deliver to the army This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part. I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.

I pledge your Grace, and if you knew what pains I have bestowed to breed this present peace, You would drink freely. But my love to you Shall show itself more openly hereafter.
 
I do not doubt you.
 
I am glad of it.- Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.
 
You wish me health in very happy season, For I am on the sudden something ill.
 
Against ill chances men are ever merry, But heaviness foreruns the good event.
 
Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus: "Some good thing comes tomorrow."
 
Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
 
So much the worse if your own rule be true.
 
The word of peace is rendered. Hark how they shout.
 
This had been cheerful after victory.
 
A peace is of the nature of a conquest, For then both parties nobly are subdued, And neither party loser.

Go, my lord, And let our army be discharged too.
 
And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains March by us, that we may peruse the men We should have coped withal.
 
Go, good Lord Hastings, And ere they be dismissed, let them march by.
 
I trust, lords, we shall lie tonight together.
 
Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?
 
The leaders, having charge from you to stand, Will not go off until they hear you speak.
 
They know their duties.
 
My lord, our army is dispersed already. Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses East, west, north, south, or, like a school broke up, Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
 
Good tidings, my Lord Hastings, for the which I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason.- And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray, Of capital treason I attach you both.

Is this proceeding just and honorable?
 
Is your assembly so?
 
Will you thus break your faith?
 
I pawned thee none. I promised you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain, which, by mine honor, I will perform with a most Christian care. But for you rebels, look to taste the due Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours. Most shallowly did you these arms commence, Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.- Strike up our drums; pursue the scattered stray. God, and not we, hath safely fought today.- Some guard these traitors to the block of death, Treason's true bed and yielder-up of breath.

What's your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and of what place, I pray?
 
I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the Dale.
 
Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your degree, and your place the Dale. Colevile shall be still your name, a traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place, a place deep enough so shall you be still Colevile of the Dale.
 
Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
 
As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye yield, sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death. Therefore rouse up fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
 
I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yield me.
 
I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name. An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most active fellow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me. Here comes our general.

Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while? When everything is ended, then you come. These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life, One time or other break some gallows' back.
 
I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus. I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility. I have foundered ninescore and odd posts, and here, travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and immaculate valor taken Sir John Colevile of the Dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of that? He saw me and yielded, that I may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome, "There, cousin, I came, saw, and overcame."
 
It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
 
I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him. And I beseech your Grace let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds, or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own picture on the top on 't, Colevile kissing my foot; to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not all show

Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good, and call it what you will.
 
Is thy name Colevile?
 
It is, my lord.
 
A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.
 
And a famous true subject took him.
 
I am, my lord, but as my betters are That led me hither. Had they been ruled by me, You should have won them dearer than you have.
 
I know not how they sold themselves, but thou, like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis, and I thank thee for thee.

My lord, I beseech you give me leave to go through Gloucestershire, and, when you come to court, stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.
 
Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition, Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
 
I would you had but the wit; 'twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh. But that's no marvel; he drinks no wine. There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then, when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation.

A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crury vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice. But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts' extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage, and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first human principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.

Only we want a little personal strength; And pause us till these rebels now afoot Come underneath the yoke of government.

Humphrey, my son of Gloucester, Where is the Prince your brother?
 
I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
 
And how accompanied?
 
I do not know, my lord.
 
Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?
 
No, my good lord, he is in presence here.
 
What would my lord and father?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 463 --%%--
 
Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence. How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother? He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas. Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy, And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation, after I am dead, Between his greatness and thy other brethren. Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love, Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will. For he is gracious if he be observed; He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity; Yet notwithstanding, being incensed he is flint, As humorous as winter, and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day. His temper therefore must be well observed. Chide him for faults, and do it reverently, When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth; But, being moody, give him time and scope Till that his passions, like a whale on ground, Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas, And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends, A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in, That the united vessel of their blood, Mingled with venom of suggestion (As, force perforce, the age will pour it in), Shall never leak, though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
 
I shall observe him with all care and love.
 
Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 465 --%%--
 
He is not there today; he dines in London.
 
And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that?
 
With Poins and other his continual followers.
 
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds, And he, the noble image of my youth, Is overspread with them; therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death. The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape, In forms imaginary, th' unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors. For when his headstrong riot hath no curb, When rage and hot blood are his counsellors, When means and lavish manners meet together, O, with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!
 
My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite. The Prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language, 'Tis needful that the most immodest word Be looked upon and learned; which, once attained, Your Highness knows, comes to no further use But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms, The Prince will, in the perfectness of time, Cast off his followers, and their memory Shall as a pattern or a measure live, By which his Grace must mete the lives of others, Turning past evils to advantages.

Health to my sovereign, and new happiness Added to that that I am to deliver. Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace's hand. Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all Are brought to the correction of your law. There is not now a rebel's sword unsheathed But peace puts forth her olive everywhere. The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read With every course in his particular.

O, my royal father!
 
My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
 
Be patient, princes. You do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary. Stand from him, give him air. He'll straight be well.
 
No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs. Th' incessant care and labor of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break out.
 
The people fear me, for they do observe Unfathered heirs and loathly births of nature. The seasons change their manners, as the year Had found some months asleep and leapt them over.

Will 't please your Grace to go along with us?
 
No, I will sit and watch here by the King.
 
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow, Being so troublesome a bedfellow? O polished perturbation, golden care, That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide To many a watchful night! sleep with it now; Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet As he whose brow with homely biggen bound Snores out the watch of night. O majesty, When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit Like a rich armor worn in heat of day, That scald'st with safety. By his gates of breath There lies a downy feather which stirs not; Did he suspire, that light and weightless down Perforce must move. My gracious lord, my father, This sleep is sound indeed. This is a sleep That from this golden rigol hath divorced So many English kings. Thy due from me Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood, Which nature, love, and filial tenderness Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously. My due from thee is this imperial crown, Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,

Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?
 
We left the Prince my brother here, my liege, Who undertook to sit and watch by you.
 
The Prince of Wales? Where is he? Let me see him. He is not here.
 
This door is open. He is gone this way.
 
He came not through the chamber where we stayed.
 
Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?
 
When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
 
The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go seek him out. Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death? Find him, my Lord of Warwick. Chide him hither.

This part of his conjoins with my disease And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are, How quickly nature falls into revolt When gold becomes her object! For this the foolish overcareful fathers Have broke their sleep with thoughts, Their brains with care, their bones with industry. For this they have engrossed and piled up The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold. For this they have been thoughtful to invest Their sons with arts and martial exercises- When, like the bee, tolling from every flower The virtuous sweets, Our thighs packed with wax, our mouths with honey, We bring it to the hive and, like the bees, Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste Yield his engrossments to the ending father.
 
Now, where is he that will not stay so long Till his friend sickness hath determined me?
 
My lord, I found the Prince in the next room, Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks, With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow That tyranny, which never quaffed but blood, Would, by beholding him, have washed his knife With gentle eyedrops. He is coming hither.
 
But wherefore did he take away the crown?

Lo where he comes.-Come hither to me, Harry.- Depart the chamber. Leave us here alone.

Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought. I stay too long by thee; I weary thee. Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth, Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee. Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind That it will quickly drop. My day is dim. Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours Were thine without offense, and at my death Thou hast sealed up my expectation. Thy life did manifest thou loved'st me not, And thou wilt have me die assured of it. Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts, Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart To stab at half an hour of my life. What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour? Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself, And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear That thou art crowned, not that I am dead. Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head; Only compound me with forgotten dust. Give that which gave thee life unto the worms. Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,

For now a time is come to mock at form. Harry the Fifth is crowned. Up, vanity, Down, royal state, all you sage counsillors, hence, And to the English court assemble now, From every region, apes of idleness. Now, neighbor confines, purge you of your scum. Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance, Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit The oldest sins the newest kind of ways? Be happy, he will trouble you no more. England shall double gild his treble guilt. England shall give him office, honor, might, For the fifth Harry from curbed license plucks The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent. O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows! When that my care could not withhold thy riots, What wilt thou do when riot is thy care? O, thou wilt be a wilderness again, Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants.
 
O pardon me, my liege! But for my tears, The moist impediments unto my speech, I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard The course of it so far. There is your crown, And He that wears the crown immortally Long guard it yours. If I affect it more Than as your honor and as your renown, Let me no more from this obedience rise, Which my most inward true and duteous spirit Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending. God witness with me, when I here came in And found no course of breath within your Majesty, How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign, O, let me in my present wildness die

And never live to show th' incredulous world The noble change that I have purposed. Coming to look on you, thinking you dead, And dead almost, my liege, to think you were, I spake unto this crown as having sense, And thus upbraided it: "The care on thee depending Hath fed upon the body of my father; Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold. Other, less fine in carat, is more precious, Preserving life in med'cine potable; But thou, most fine, most honored, most renowned, Hast eat thy bearer up." Thus, my most royal liege, Accusing it, I put it on my head To try with it, as with an enemy That had before my face murdered my father, The quarrel of a true inheritor. But if it did infect my blood with joy Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride, If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did with the least affection of a welcome Give entertainment to the might of it, Let God forever keep it from my head And make me as the poorest vassal is That doth with awe and terror kneel to it.
 
O my son, God put it in thy mind to take it hence That thou mightst win the more thy father's love, Pleading so wisely in excuse of it. Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed And hear, I think, the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son, By what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways I met this crown, and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head. To thee it shall descend with better quiet,

Better opinion, better confirmation, For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth. It seemed in me But as an honor snatched with boist'rous hand, And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances, Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed, Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears Thou see'st with peril I have answered, For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that argument. And now my death Changes the mood, for what in me was purchased Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort. So thou the garland wear'st successively. Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do, Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green, And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out, By whose fell working I was first advanced And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displaced; which to avoid, I cut them off and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land, Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry, Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out, May waste the memory of the former days. More would I, but my lungs are wasted so That strength of speech is utterly denied me. How I came by the crown, O God forgive, And grant it may with thee in true peace live.

And in th' administration of his law, Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth, Your Highness pleased to forget my place, The majesty and power of law and justice, The image of the King whom I presented, And struck me in my very seat of judgment, Whereon, as an offender to your father, I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you. If the deed were ill, Be you contented, wearing now the garland, To have a son set your decrees at nought? To pluck down justice from your awful bench? To trip the course of law and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person? Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image And mock your workings in a second body? Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours; Be now the father and propose a son, Hear your own dignity so much profaned, See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted, Behold yourself so by a son disdained, And then imagine me taking your part And in your power soft silencing your son. After this cold considerance, sentence me, And, as you are a king, speak in your state

What I have done that misbecame my place, My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
 
You are right, justice, and you weigh this well. Therefore still bear the balance and the sword. And I do wish your honors may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you and obey you as I did. So shall I live to speak my father's words: "Happy am I that have a man so bold That dares do justice on my proper son; And not less happy, having such a son That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice." You did commit me, For which I do commit into your hand Th' unstained sword that you have used to bear, With this remembrance: that you use the same With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand. You shall be as a father to my youth, My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear, And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well-practiced wise directions.- And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you: My father is gone wild into his grave, For in his tomb lie my affections, And with his spirit sadly I survive To mock the expectation of the world, To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down After my seeming. The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now. Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea, Where it shall mingle with the state of floods And flow henceforth in formal majesty. Now call we our high court of parliament,

First my fear; then my curtsy, last my speech. My fear is your displeasure my curtsy my duty; and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this, which, if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely. And so I kneel down before you, but, indeed, to pray for the Queen. If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before in such an assembly. One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France, where, for anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already he be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.

My lord, I'll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.
 
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
 
It must be thought on. If it pass against us, We lose the better half of our possession, For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us, being valued thus: "As much as would maintain, to the King's honor, Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, Six thousand and two hundred good esquires; And, to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil, A hundred almshouses right well supplied; And to the coffers of the King besides, A thousand pounds by th' year." Thus runs the bill.

Turn him to any cause of policy, The Gordian knot of it he will unloose Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks, The air, a chartered libertine, is still, And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences; So that the art and practic part of life Must be the mistress to this theoric; Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it, Since his addiction was to courses vain, His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow, His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports, And never noted in him any study, Any retirement, any sequestration From open haunts and popularity.

It must be so, for miracles are ceased, And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected.
 
But, my good lord, How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no?
 
He seems indifferent, Or rather swaying more upon our part Than cherishing th' exhibitors against us; For I have made an offer to his Majesty- Upon our spiritual convocation And in regard of causes now in hand, Which I have opened to his Grace at large, As touching France-to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal.

Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salic is in Germany, Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe, Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons, There left behind and settled certain French, Who, holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life, Established then this law: to wit, no female Should be inheritrix in Salic land, Which "Salic," as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.

Then doth it well appear the Salic law Was not devised for the realm of France, Nor did the French possess the Salic land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond, Idly supposed the founder of this law; Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala in the year Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say, King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, Did, as heir general, being descended Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair, Make claim and title to the crown of France. Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, To find his title with some shows of truth, Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught, Conveyed himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare, Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth, Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, Could not keep quiet in his conscience, Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother, Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine, By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France. So that, as clear as is the summer's sun, King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female.

The sin upon my head, dread sovereign, For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: "When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord, Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag, Look back into your mighty ancestors. Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb, From whom you claim. Invoke his warlike spirit And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince, Who on the French ground played a tragedy, Making defeat on the full power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp Forage in blood of French nobility. O noble English, that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by, All out of work and cold for action!
 
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats. You are their heir, you sit upon their throne, The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth, Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

She hath been then more feared than harmed, my liege, For hear her but exampled by herself: When all her chivalry hath been in France And she a mourning widow of her nobles, She hath herself not only well defended But taken and impounded as a stray The king of Scots, whom she did send to France To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings And make her chronicle as rich with praise As is the ooze and bottom of the sea With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.
 
But there's a saying very old and true: "If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin." For once the eagle England being in prey, To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat.
 
It follows, then, the cat must stay at home. Yet that is but a crushed necessity, Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves. While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, Th' advised head defends itself at home. For government, though high and low and lower, Put into parts, doth keep in one consent, Congreeing in a full and natural close, Like music.

Therefore doth heaven divide The state of man in diverse functions, Setting endeavor in continual motion, To which is fixed as an aim or butt Obedience; for so work the honeybees, Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom. They have a king and officers of sorts, Where some like magistrates correct at home, Others like merchants venture trade abroad, Others like soldiers armed in their stings Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent royal of their emperor, Who, busied in his majesty, surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold, The civil citizens kneading up the honey, The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate, The sad-eyed justice with his surly hum Delivering o'er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone. I this infer: That many things, having full reference To one consent, may work contrariously, As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town, As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea, As many lines close in the dial's center, So may a thousand actions, once afoot, End in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege! Divide your happy England into four, Whereof take you one quarter into France, And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.

Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
 
Now are we well resolved, and by God's help And yours, the noble sinews of our power, France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe Or break it all to pieces. Or there we'll sit, Ruling in large and ample empery O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms, Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, Tombless, with no remembrance over them. Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave, Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth, Not worshipped with a waxen epitaph.
 
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
 
May 't please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge, Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?

We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons. Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
 
Thus, then, in few: Your Highness, lately sending into France, Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third; In answer of which claim, the prince our master Says that you savor too much of your youth And bids you be advised there's naught in France That can be with a nimble galliard won. You cannot revel into dukedoms there. He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
 
What treasure, uncle?
 
Tennis balls, my liege.
 
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us. His present and your pains we thank you for. When we have matched our rackets to these balls, We will in France, by God's grace, play a set Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard. Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturbed With chases. And we understand him well, How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them.

We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home. But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness When I do rouse me in my throne of France, For that I have laid by my majesty And plodded like a man for working days. But I will rise there with so full a glory That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his Hath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soul Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands, Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down, And some are yet ungotten and unborn That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn. But this lies all within the will of God, To whom I do appeal, and in whose name Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on, To venge me as I may and to put forth My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause. So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it. -Convey them with safe conduct.-Fare you well.
 
This was a merry message.

For, God before, We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door. Therefore let every man now task his thought, That this fair action may on foot be brought.

Now all the youth of England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies. Now thrive the armorers, and honor's thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man. They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, Following the mirror of all Christian kings With winged heels, as English Mercurys. For now sits Expectation in the air And hides a sword, from hilts unto the point, With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets Promised to Harry and his followers. The French, advised by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation, Shake in their fear, and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes. O England, model to thy inward greatness, Like little body with a mighty heart, What might'st thou do, that honor would thee do, Were all thy children kind and natural! But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out, A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills With treacherous crowns, and three corrupted men- One, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and the second, Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland- Have, for the gilt of France (Oh, guilt indeed!), Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France, And by their hands this grace of kings must die, If hell and treason hold their promises,

Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
 
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
 
For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though? It will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man's sword will, and there's an end.
 
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France. Let 't be so, good Corporal Nym.
 
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the certain of it. And when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it.
 
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her.
 
I cannot tell. Things must be as they may. Men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time, and some say knives have edges. It must be as it may. Though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell.

My Lord of Cambridge here, You know how apt our love was to accord To furnish him with all appurtenants Belonging to his honor, and this man Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired, And sworn unto the practices of France, To kill us here in Hampton; to the which This knight, no less for bounty bound to us Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.-But Oh, What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel, Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature? Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, That knew'st the very bottom of my soul, That almost mightst have coined me into gold, Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use- May it be possible that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange That, though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it. Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose, Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them.

But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in Wonder to wait on treason and on murder, And whatsoever cunning fiend it was That wrought upon thee so preposterously Hath got the voice in hell for excellence. All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched From glist'ring semblances of piety. But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up, Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor. If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world, He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions "I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman's." Oh, how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful? Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned? Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family? Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious? Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet, Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger, Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood, Garnished and decked in modest complement, Not working with the eye without the ear, And but in purged judgment trusting neither? Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem. And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full-fraught man and best endued With some suspicion. I will weep for thee, For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man.-Their faults are open. Arrest them to the answer of the law, And God acquit them of their practices.

Our purposes God justly hath discovered, And I repent my fault more than my death, Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive, Although my body pay the price of it.
 
For me, the gold of France did not seduce, Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended; But God be thanked for prevention, Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice, Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
 
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself, Prevented from a damned enterprise. My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

Hear your sentence: You have conspired against our royal person, Joined with an enemy proclaimed, and from his coffers Received the golden earnest of our death, Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter, His princes and his peers to servitude, His subjects to oppression and contempt, And his whole kingdom into desolation. Touching our person, seek we no revenge, But we our kingdom's safety must so tender, Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws We do deliver you.

I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone.

Say, if my father render fair return, It is against my will, for I desire Nothing but odds with England. To that end, As matching to his youth and vanity, I did present him with the Paris balls.
 
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it, Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe. And be assured you'll find a difference, As we his subjects have in wonder found, Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now. Now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain.

Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen The well-appointed king at Hampton pier Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning. Play with your fancies and in them behold, Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing. Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give To sounds confused. Behold the threaden sails, Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind, Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea, Breasting the lofty surge. Oh, do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th' inconstant billows dancing, For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow! Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy And leave your England, as dead midnight still, Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women, Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance, For who is he whose chin is but enriched With one appearing hair that will not follow These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France? Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege. Behold the ordnance on their carriages, With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur. Suppose th' Ambassador from the French comes back, Tells Harry that the king doth offer him

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, Or close the wall up with our English dead! In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility, But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger: Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage, Then lend the eye a terrible aspect, Let pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon, let the brow o'erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base, Swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean. Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height. On, on, you noblest English, Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof, Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument. Dishonor not your mothers. Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you. Be copy now to men of grosser blood, And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture. Let us swear That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not,

As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers. I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me. For indeed three such antics do not amount to a man: for Bardolph, he is white-livered and red-faced, by the means whereof he faces it out but fights not; for Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword, by the means whereof he breaks words and keeps whole weapons; for Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest he should be thought a coward, but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds, for he never broke any man's head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.

Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines; the duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
 
To the mines? Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war. The concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines. By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions.
 
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
 
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
 
I think it be.
 
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world. I will verify as much in his beard. He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
 
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman, that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.
 
I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.
 
Godden to your Worship, good Captain James.
 
How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit the mines? Have the pioneers given o'er?
 
By Chrish, la, 'tish ill done. The work ish give over. The trompet sound the retreat. By my hand I swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done. It ish give over. I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. Oh, 'tish ill done, 'tish ill done, by my hand, 'tish ill done.
 
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars? In the way of argument, look you, and friendly communication, partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, that is the point.

The town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the breach, and we talk and, be Chrish, do nothing, 'tis shame for us all. So God sa' me, 'tis shame to stand still. It is shame, by my hand. And there is throats to be cut and works to be done, and there ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la.

Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation-
 
Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal. What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?
 
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as, in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities.
 
I do not know you so good a man as myself. So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.

How yet resolves the governor of the town? This is the latest parle we will admit. Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or, like to men proud of destruction, Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts becomes me best, If I begin the batt'ry once again, I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried. The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart, In liberty of bloody hand, shall range With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants. What is it then to me if impious war, Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends, Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats Enlinked to waste and desolation? What is 't to me, when you yourselves are cause, If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation? What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career? We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur, Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command, Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace

O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy. If not, why, in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Desire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters, Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls, Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen. What say you? Will you yield and this avoid Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?
 
Our expectation hath this day an end. The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated, Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great King, We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy. Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, For we no longer are defensible.
 
Open your gates.
 
Come, uncle Exeter, Go you and enter Harfleur. There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French. Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle, The winter coming on and sickness growing Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais. Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.

How now, Captain Fluellen? Come you from the bridge?
 
I assure you, there is very excellent services committed at the bridge.
 
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
 
The duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power. He is not, God be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge. I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation in the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.
 
What do you call him?
 
He is called Aunchient Pistol.
 
I know him not.
 
Here is the man.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 122 --%%--
 
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors. The duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
 
Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.
 
Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart And of buxom valor, hath, by cruel Fate And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel, That goddess blind That stands upon the rolling restless stone-
 
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant, and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.
 
Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him, For he hath stolen a pax and hanged must he be. A damned death! Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free, And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate. But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price. Therefore go speak-the duke will hear thy voice- And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach. Speak, Captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
 
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
 
Why then, rejoice therefore.

Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at, for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution, for discipline ought to be used.
 
Die and be damned, and <i>figo</i> for thy friendship!
 
It is well.
 
The fig of Spain!
 
Very good.
 
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal. I remember him now, a bawd, a cutpurse.
 
I'll assure you, he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.
 
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done-at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on. And this they con perfectly in the phrase of war, which they

trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be marvelously mistook.
 
I tell you what, Captain Gower. I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him my mind.
 
Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with him from the pridge.-God pless your Majesty.
 
How now, Fluellen, cam'st thou from the bridge?
 
Ay, so please your Majesty. The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge. The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th' athversary was have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to retire, and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a prave man.
 
What men have you lost, Fluellen?
 
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o' fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's out.

We would have all such offenders so cut off, and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
 
You know me by my habit.
 
Well then, I know thee. What shall I know of thee?
 
My master's mind.
 
Unfold it.
 
Thus says my king: "Say thou to Harry of England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep. Advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his

weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th' effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this, add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced." So far my king and master; so much my office.
 
What is thy name? I know thy quality.
 
Montjoy.
 
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back, And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment, for, to say the sooth, Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage, My people are with sickness much enfeebled, My numbers lessened, and those few I have Almost no better than so many French, Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald, I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God, That I do brag thus. This your air of France Hath blown that vice in me. I must repent. Go therefore, tell thy master: here I am. My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk, My army but a weak and sickly guard, Yet, God before, tell him we will come on Though France himself and such another neighbor Stand in our way. There's for thy labor, Montjoy. Go bid thy master well advise himself: If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered, We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolor. And so, Montjoy, fare you well. The sum of all our answer is but this: We would not seek a battle as we are, Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it. So tell your master.

Turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. 'Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on, and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: "Wonder of nature-"
 
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
 
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.

Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe. From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, The hum of either army stilly sounds, That the fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other's watch. Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames Each battle sees the other's umbered face. Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents The armorers, accomplishing the knights, With busy hammers closing rivets up, Give dreadful note of preparation. The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll, And, the third hour of drowsy morning named, Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, The confident and overlusty French Do the low-rated English play at dice And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night, Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away. The poor condemned English, Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The morning's danger; and their gesture sad, Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats, Presenteth them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts. Oh, now, who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band

Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him, Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all-watched night, But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty, That every wretch, pining and pale before, Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks. A largess universal, like the sun, His liberal eye doth give to everyone, Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all Behold, as may unworthiness define, A little touch of Harry in the night. And so our scene must to the battle fly, Where, Oh, for pity, we shall much disgrace, With four or five most vile and ragged foils Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous, The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see, Minding true things by what their mock'ries be.

No. Nor it is not meet he should, for, though I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.

He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
 
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king. I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.
 
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
 
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds. Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
 
That's more than we know.
 
Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know enough if we know we are the king's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.
 
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, "We died at such a place," some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it, who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.

So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him. Or if a servant, under his master's command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so. The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel. Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained. And in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.

And, but for ceremony, such a wretch, Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, Had the forehand and vantage of a king.

In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie, Larding the plain, and by his bloody side, Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds, The noble earl of Suffolk also lies. Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over, Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face. And cries aloud, "Tarry, my cousin Suffolk. My soul shall thine keep company to heaven. Tarry, sweet soul, for mine; then fly abreast, As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our chivalry." Upon these words I came and cheered him up. He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand, And with a feeble grip, says "Dear my lord, Commend my service to my sovereign." So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck

Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born?
 
Alexander the Great.
 
Why, I pray you, is not "pig" great? The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations.
 
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon. His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
 
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I tell you, Captain, if you look in the maps of the 'orld, I warrant you shall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike.

There is a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river. But 'tis all one; 'tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.
 
Our king is not like him in that. He never killed any of his friends.
 
It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth, being in his right wits and his good judgments, turned away the fat knight with the great-belly doublet; he was full of jests, and gipes and knaveries, and mocks-I have forgot his name.

They do offend our sight. If they'll do neither, we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforced from the old Assyrian slings. Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have, And not a man of them that we shall take Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.

His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
 
How now, what means this, herald? Know'st thou not That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom? Com'st thou again for ransom?
 
No, great king. I come to thee for charitable license, That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them; To sort our nobles from our common men, For many of our princes-woe the while!- Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood. So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters, Killing them twice. Oh, give us leave, great king, To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies.

O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
 
<i>Pardonnez-moi,</i> I cannot tell what is "like me."
 
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
 
<i>(to</i> ALICE<i>) Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable a les anges?</i>
 
<i>Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Grace, ainsi dit-il.</i>

I said so, dear Katherine; and I must not blush to affirm it.
 
<i>O bon Dieu! Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.</i>
 
What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
 
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits; dat is de princess.
 
The princess is the better Englishwoman.-I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, "I love you." Then if you urge me farther than to say, "Do you, in faith?" I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i' faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?
 
<i>Sauf votre honneur,</i> me understand vell.
 
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me. For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation, only
 
--%%-- pageNum: 260 --%%--
 
downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee too. And while thou liv'st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me. And take me, take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what say'st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
 
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
 
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
 
I cannot tell wat is dat.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 262 --%%--
 
No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi-let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!- donc v&ocirc;tre est France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.
 
<i>Sauf votre honneur, le francais que vous parlez, il est meilleur que l'anglais lequel je parle.</i>
 
No, faith, is 't not, Kate, but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English? Canst thou love me?
 
I cannot tell.
 
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I'll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you'll question this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis

No, 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle  <i>Katherine du monde, mon tres cher et divin deesse?</i>
 
Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage <i>demoiselle</i> dat is <i>en</i> France.
 
Now fie upon my false French. By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew my father's ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear. My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say "Harry of England, I am thine," which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell

Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is music and thy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt thou have me?
 
Dat is as it sall please de <i>roi mon pere.</i>
 
Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.

Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.

Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?

O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion. We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss. Therefore, patiently and yielding. <i>(kissing her)</i> You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council, and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.
 
God save your Majesty. My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?
 
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
 
Is she not apt?
 
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 270 --%%--
 
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.
 
Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
 
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do.
 
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
 
I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning, for maids, well summered and warm kept, are like flies at Bartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their eyes; and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.
 
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer. And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end and she must be blind too.
 
As love is, my lord, before it loves.
 
It is so. And you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
 
Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turned into a maid, for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered.

Shall Kate be my wife?
 
So please you.
 
I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her. So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.
 
We have consented to all terms of reason.
 
Is 't so, my lords of England?
 
The king hath granted every article, His daughter first, and, in sequel, all, According to their firm proposed natures.
 
Only he hath not yet subscribed this: Where your Majesty demands that the king of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition, in French: <i>Notre tres cher fils Henri, roi d'Angleterre, heritier de France</i>; and thus in Latin: <i>Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, rex Angliae, et haeres Franciae.</i>
 
Nor this I have not, brother, so denied But your request shall make me let it pass.
 
I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest, And thereupon give me your daughter.
 
Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up Issue to me, that the contending kingdoms Of France and England, whose very shores look pale With envy of each other's happiness,

God, the best maker of all marriages, Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one. As man and wife, being two, are one in love, So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal That never may ill office or fell jealousy, Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage, Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms To make divorce of their incorporate league, That English may as French, French Englishmen, Receive each other. God speak this "amen"!
 
Amen.

But wherefore art not in thy shop today? Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
 
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
 
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home? What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels? You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things, O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft Have you climbed up to walls and battlements, To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops, Your infants in your arms, and there have sat The livelong day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome. And when you saw his chariot but appear, Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores? And do you now put on your best attire? And do you now cull out a holiday?

See whether their basest metal be not moved. They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness. Go you down that way towards the Capitol. This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies.

It is no matter. Let no images Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets. So do you too, where you perceive them thick.

I pray you, do.
 
I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I'll leave you.
 
Brutus, I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you.
 
Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors. But let not therefore, my good friends, be grieved- Among which number, Cassius, be you one- Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men.
 
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
 
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 14 --%%--
 
'Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age's yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.
 
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me?
 
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And, after, scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
 
What means this shouting? I do fear, the people Choose Caesar for their king.
 
Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 16 --%%--
 
I would not, Cassius. Yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i' th' other, And I will look on both indifferently, For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death.
 
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life, but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar. So were you. We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter's cold as well as he. For once upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plunged in And bade him follow. So indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!" I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man

Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake! His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books- "Alas," it cried, "give me some drink, Titinius," As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone.
 
Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
 
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Brutus and Caesar-what should be in that "Caesar"? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name. Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well. Weigh them, it is as heavy. Conjure with 'em,

"Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar." Now in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, When there is in it but one only man. Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.
 
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us.
 
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today.
 
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators.
 
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
 
Antonio.
 
Caesar.
 
<i>(aside to</i> ANTONY<i>)</i> Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.

He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony. He hears no music. Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
 
<i>(to</i> BRUTUS<i>)</i>  You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me?
 
Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad.
 
Why, you were with him, were you not?
 
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
 
Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.

What was the second noise for?
 
Why, for that too.

Why, for that too.
 
Was the crown offered him thrice?
 
Ay, marry, was 't, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted.
 
Who offered him the crown?
 
Why, Antony.
 
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
 
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery. I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once-but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again-but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by. And still, as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar-for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.

But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?
 
He fell down in the marketplace, and foamed at mouth, and was speechless.
 
'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
 
No, Caesar hath it not. But you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
 
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
 
What said he when he came unto himself?
 
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and forgave him with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken of them. If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.
 
And after that he came thus sad away?
 
Ay.

Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' th' face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But, for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too. Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.
 
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
 
No, I am promised forth.
 
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
 
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating.
 
Good. I will expect you.

So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite.
 
And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you. Or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
 
I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
 
Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes, For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at. And after this let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home? Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?
 
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds, But never till tonight, never till now, Did I go through a tempest dropping fire. Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction.
 
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
 
A common slave-you know him well by sight- Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn Like twenty torches joined, and yet his hand, Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched. Besides-I ha' not since put up my sword- Against the Capitol I met a lion, Who glared upon me and went surly by, Without annoying me. And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.

And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, "These are their reasons. They are natural." For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon.
 
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time. But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
 
He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
 
Good night then, Casca. This disturbed sky Is not to walk in.
 
Farewell, Cicero.
 
Who's there?
 
A Roman.
 
Casca, by your voice.
 
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
 
A very pleasing night to honest men.
 
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 38 --%%--
 
Those that have known the earth so full of faults. For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone. And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.
 
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
 
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens. But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, Why old men fool and children calculate, Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformed faculties To monstrous quality-why, you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night, That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol-
 
--%%-- pageNum: 40 --%%--
 
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown, And fearful as these strange eruptions are.
 
'Tis Caesar that you mean. Is it not, Cassius?
 
Let it be who it is. For Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors, But-woe the while!-our fathers' minds are dead, And we are governed with our mothers' spirits. Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
 
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy.
 
I know where I will wear this dagger then. Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong. Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat. Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit. But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself. If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.
 
So can I. So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 42 --%%--
 
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then? Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep. He were no lion were not Romans hinds. Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome, What rubbish and what offal, when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief, Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman. Then I know My answer must be made. But I am armed, And dangers are to me indifferent.
 
You speak to Casca, and to such a man That is no fleering telltale. Hold, my hand. Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.
 
There's a bargain made. Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence. And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey's porch. For now, this fearful night, There is no stir or walking in the streets, And the complexion of the element In favor's like the work we have in hand, Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
 
I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this! There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
 
Am I not stayed for? Tell me.
 
Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party-
 
Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor's chair Where Brutus may but find it. And throw this In at his window. Set this up with wax Upon old Brutus' statue. All this done, Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us. Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
 
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie, And so bestow these papers as you bade me.

Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him Is ours already, and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
 
Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts, And that which would appear offense in us, His countenance, like richest alchemy, Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
 
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited. Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him.

Get me a taper in my study, Lucius. When it is lighted, come and call me here.
 
I will, my lord.
 
It must be by his death, and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general. He would be crowned. How that might change his nature, there's the question. It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with.

Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections swayed More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition's ladder, Whereto the climber upward turns his face. But when he once attains the upmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend. So Caesar may. Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities. And therefore think him as a serpent's egg- Which, hatched, would as his kind grow mischievous- And kill him in the shell.
 
The taper burneth in your closet, sir. Searching the window for a flint, I found This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed.  <i>(gives him a letter)</i>
 
Get you to bed again. It is not day. Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them.  <i>(opens the letter and reads)</i>  "Brutus, thou sleep'st. Awake, and see thyself.

Such instigations have been often dropped Where I have took them up. -"Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out: "Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?" What, Rome? My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was called a king. -"Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, If the redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
 
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

Is he alone?
 
No, sir, there are more with him.
 
Do you know them?
 
No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor.

<i>(comes forward with</i> CASSIUS<i>)</i>  Give me your hands all over, one by one.  <i>(shakes their hands)</i>

No, not an oath. If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse- If these be motives weak, break off betimes, And every man hence to his idle bed. So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery. But if these- As I am sure they do-bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress? What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter? And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged, That this shall be, or we will fall for it? Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs. Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt. But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears-and nobly bears- Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him.

Indeed he is not fit.
 
Shall no man else be touched but only Caesar?
 
Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him A shrewd contriver. And, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
 
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards, For Antony is but a limb of Caesar. Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius. We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood. Oh, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends, Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully. Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds. And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious, Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers. And for Mark Antony, think not of him, For he can do no more than Caesar's arm When Caesar's head is off.

Yet I fear him. For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar-
 
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him. If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar. And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness and much company.
 
There is no fear in him. Let him not die, For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.
 
Peace! Count the clock.
 
The clock hath stricken three.
 
'Tis time to part.
 
But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no. For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies. It may be, these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today.
 
Never fear that. If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him. For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers. But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flattered. Let me work. For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol.

Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now? It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.
 
Nor for yours neither. Y' have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed. And yesternight, at supper, You suddenly arose and walked about, Musing and sighing, with your arms across, And when I asked you what the matter was, You stared upon me with ungentle looks. I urged you further, then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot. Yet I insisted; yet you answered not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did, Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor, Which sometime hath his hour with every man. It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep, And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevailed on your condition, I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord, Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

I am not well in health, and that is all.
 
Brutus is wise, and were he not in health, He would embrace the means to come by it.
 
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
 
Is Brutus sick? And is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humors Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed, To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus. You have some sick offense within your mind, Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of.  <i>(kneels)</i> And upon my knees I charm you, by my once-commended beauty, By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me, your self, your half, Why you are heavy, and what men tonight Have had to resort to you. For here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness.
 
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
 
<i>(rising)</i> I should not need if you were gentle, Brutus. Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you? Am I yourself But, as it were, in sort or limitation, To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, And talk to you sometimes?

You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.
 
If this were true, then should I know this secret. I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife. I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter. Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded? Tell me your counsels. I will not disclose 'em. I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience, And not my husband's secrets?
 
O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!
 
Hark, hark! One knocks. Portia, go in awhile. And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart. All my engagements I will construe to thee, All the charactery of my sad brows. Leave me with haste.

Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your house today.
 
Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back. When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
 
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me. There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelped in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 80 --%%--
 
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol. The noise of battle hurtled in the air. Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. O Caesar! These things are beyond all use, And I do fear them.
 
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
 
When beggars die there are no comets seen. The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
 
Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.
 
What say the augurers?
 
They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast.
 
The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well

Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home.

Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the senate house.
 
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today. "Cannot" is false, and that I dare not, falser. I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.
 
Say he is sick.
 
Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 84 --%%--
 
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
 
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
 
The cause is in my will. I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood. And many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
 
This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia's dream is signified.
 
And this way have you well expounded it.
 
I have, when you have heard what I can say. And know it now: the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 86 --%%--
 
If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be rendered for someone to say, "Break up the senate till another time When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams." If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper, "Lo, Caesar is afraid"? Pardon me, Caesar. For my dear, dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable.
 
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I am ashamed I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go.
 
And look, where Publius is come to fetch me.
 
Good morrow, Caesar.
 
Welcome, Publius. -What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too? -Good morrow, Casca.-Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean. -What is 't o'clock?

I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there. -O constancy, be strong upon my side, Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue! I have a man's mind but a woman's might. How hard it is for women to keep counsel! -Art thou here yet?
 
Madam, what should I do? Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? And so return to you, and nothing else?
 
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well, For he went sickly forth. And take good note What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him. Hark, boy! What noise is that?
 
I hear none, madam.
 
Prithee, listen well. I heard a bustling rumor like a fray, And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
 
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

Come hither, fellow. Which way hast thou been?
 
At mine own house, good lady.
 
What is 't o'clock?
 
About the ninth hour, lady.
 
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
 
Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.
 
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
 
That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
 
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
 
None that I know will be; much that I fear may chance. Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow. The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death. I'll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his senate must redress?
 
<i>(kneeling)</i>  Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart-
 
I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond, To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools-I mean, sweet words, Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banished. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied.
 
Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear For the repealing of my banished brother?
 
<i>(kneeling)</i> I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

What, Brutus?
 
<i>(kneeling)</i>Pardon, Caesar. Caesar, pardon. As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
 
I could be well moved if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks. They are all fire and every one doth shine, But there's but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world. 'Tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive, Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion. And that I am he Let me a little show it even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished, And constant do remain to keep him so.

People and senators, be not affrighted. Fly not. Stand still. Ambition's debt is paid.
 
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
 
And Cassius too.
 
Where's Publius?
 
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday.
 
Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die, we know. 'Tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
 
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
 
Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And waving our red weapons o'er our heads Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"
 
Stoop, then, and wash.

So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called "The men that gave their country liberty."

Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

<i>(kneeling)</i> Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.  <i>(falls prostrate)</i> Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest.

If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
 
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched.
 
<i>(rising)</i>I'll fetch him presently.
 
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
 
I wish we may. But yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
 
But here comes Antony.-Welcome, Mark Antony.
 
O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well. -I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.

If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die. No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age.
 
O Antony, beg not your death of us. Though now we must appear bloody and cruel- As by our hands and this our present act You see we do-yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not. They are pitiful. And pity to the general wrong of Rome- As fire drives out fire, so pity pity- Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers' temper do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
 
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities.
 
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear, And then we will deliver you the cause, Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded.

I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand.  <i>(shakes hands with the conspirators)</i>  First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you. -Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand. -Now, Decius Brutus, yours.-Now yours, Metellus. -Yours, Cinna.-And, my valiant Casca, yours. -Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius. -Gentlemen all, alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer -That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true. If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes- Most noble!-in the presence of thy corse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart; Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand, Signed in thy spoil, and crimsoned in thy lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer, strucken by many princes, Dost thou here lie!
 
Mark Antony-
 
Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends? Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
 
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope: that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
 
Or else were this a savage spectacle! Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied.
 
That's all I seek. And am moreover suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral.
 
You shall, Mark Antony.
 
Brutus, a word with you.  <i>(aside to</i> BRUTUS<i>)</i> You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter?

Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, And say you do 't by our permission. Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended.
 
Be it so. I do desire no more.
 
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
 
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers! Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy- Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue- A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.

Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy. Blood and destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful objects so familiar, That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds, And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men, groaning for burial.
 
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
 
I do, Mark Antony.
 
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
 
He did receive his letters and is coming. And bid me say to you by word of mouth-  <i>(sees</i> CAESAR<i>'s body)</i> O Caesar!-
 
Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming?

According to the which, thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand.

Then follow me and give me audience, friends. -Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers. -Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here. Those that will follow Cassius, go with him, And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death.
 
I will hear Brutus speak.
 
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered.
 
The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
 
Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.

Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak-for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak-for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak-for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
 
None, Brutus, none.
 
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol. His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.
 
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying-a place in the commonwealth-as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death.

Good countrymen, let me depart alone. And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony By our permission is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
 
Stay, ho! And let us hear Mark Antony.

Nay, that's certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
 
Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.
 
You gentle Romans-
 
Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest- For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men- Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 134 --%%--
 
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And, sure, he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. <i>(weeps)</i>
 
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
 
If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.
 
Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place.
 
Marked ye his words? He would not take the crown. Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
 
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
 
Poor soul! His eyes are red as fire with weeping.
 
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 136 --%%--
 
Now mark him. He begins again to speak.
 
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong- Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament- Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read- And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood, Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue.
 
We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony!
 
The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
 
Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad. 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs. For, if you should-Oh, what would come of it!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 138 --%%--
 
Read the will. We'll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
 
Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.
 
They were traitors! "Honorable men"!
 
The will! The testament!
 
They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!
 
You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?
 
Come down.
 
Descend.
 
You shall have leave.
 
A ring! Stand round.
 
Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body.

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. 'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed. And as he plucked his cursed steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors, to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no. For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey's statue, Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. Oh, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here, Here is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.  <i>(lifts up</i> CAESAR'<i>s mantle)</i>

Good friends, sweet friends! Let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable, And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend. And that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit nor words nor worth, Action nor utterance nor the power of speech, To stir men's blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

These many, then, shall die. Their names are pricked.
 
<i>(to</i> LEPIDUS<i>)</i>  Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus?
 
I do consent-
 
Prick him down, Antony.
 
Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
 
He shall not live. Look, with a spot I damn him. But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house. Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies.
 
What, shall I find you here?
 
Or here, or at the Capitol.
 
This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit, The threefold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 156 --%%--
 
So you thought him. And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription.
 
Octavius, I have seen more days than you. And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way. And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off, Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears And graze in commons.
 
You may do your will, But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
 
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender. It is a creature that I teach to fight, To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His corporal motion governed by my spirit, And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so. He must be taught and trained and bid go forth, A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds On objects, arts, and imitations, Which, out of use and staled by other men, Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him But as a property. And now, Octavius, Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers. We must straight make head. Therefore let our alliance be combined, Our best friends made, our means stretched.

And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosed, And open perils surest answered.

Stand, ho!
 
Give the word, ho, and stand.
 
What now, Lucillius? Is Cassius near?
 
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master.
 
He greets me well.-Your master, Pindarus, In his own change or by ill officers Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done, undone. But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied.
 
I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
 
He is not doubted.-A word, Lucillius.  <i>(takes</i> LUCILLIUS <i>aside)</i>  How he received you, let me be resolved.
 
With courtesy and with respect enough. But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old.
 
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucillius, When love begins to sicken and decay, It useth an enforced ceremony. There are no tricks in plain and simple faith. But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, Make gallant show and promise of their mettle.

Hark! He is arrived. March gently on to meet him.
 
Stand, ho!

Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
 
Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies? And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 164 --%%--
 
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs. And when you do them-
 
Cassius, be content. Speak your griefs softly. I do know you well. Before the eyes of both our armies here, Which should perceive nothing but love from us, Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away. Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs, And I will give you audience.
 
Pindarus, Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground.
 
Lucillius, do you the like. And let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference. Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 166 --%%--
 
That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
 
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
 
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment.
 
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers.
 
I "an itching palm"! You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
 
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
 
Chastisement!
 
Remember March, the ides of March remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 168 --%%--
 
What villain touched his body, that did stab, And not for justice? What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes, And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus? I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman.
 
Brutus, bait not me. I'll not endure it. You forget yourself To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions.
 
Go to. You are not, Cassius.
 
I am.
 
I say you are not.
 
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself. Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
 
Away, slight man!
 
Is 't possible?
 
Hear me, for I will speak. Must I give way and room to your rash choler? Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
 
O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 170 --%%--
 
"All this"? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break. Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge? Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor? By the gods, You shall digest the venom of your spleen, Though it do split you. For from this day forth, I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, When you are waspish.
 
Is it come to this?
 
You say you are a better soldier. Let it appear so. Make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well. For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
 
You wrong me every way. You wrong me, Brutus. I said an elder soldier, not a better. Did I say "better"?
 
If you did, I care not.
 
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
 
Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
 
I durst not!
 
No.
 
What, durst not tempt him?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 172 --%%--
 
For your life you durst not.
 
Do not presume too much upon my love. I may do that I shall be sorry for.
 
You have done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means. By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts. Dash him to pieces!
 
I denied you not.
 
You did.
 
I did not. He was but a fool that brought My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart. A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
 
I do not, till you practice them on me.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 174 --%%--
 
You love me not.
 
I do not like your faults.
 
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
 
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus.
 
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come, Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is aweary of the world- Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother; Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed, Set in a notebook, learned, and conned by rote To cast into my teeth. Oh, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes.  <i>(offers</i> BRUTUS <i>his bared dagger)</i> There is my dagger. And here my naked breast. Within, a heart Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold. If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth. I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart. Strike, as thou didst at Caesar. For I know When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
 
Sheathe your dagger. Be angry when you will, it shall have scope. Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 176 --%%--
 
Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?
 
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
 
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
 
And my heart too.
 
O Brutus!
 
What's the matter?
 
Have not you love enough to bear with me, When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful?
 
Yes, Cassius. And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He'll think your mother chides and leave you so.
 
<i>(within)</i> Let me go in to see the generals. There is some grudge between 'em. 'Tis not meet They be alone.
 
<i>(within)</i> You shall not come to them.

How now? What's the matter?
 
For shame, you generals! What do you mean? Love, and be friends as two such men should be. For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
 
Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
 
<i>(to</i> POET<i>)</i> Get you hence, sirrah. Saucy fellow, hence!
 
Bear with him, Brutus. 'Tis his fashion.
 
I'll know his humor when he knows his time. What should the wars do with these jigging fools? -Companion, hence!
 
Away, away, be gone.
 
Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
 
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you, Immediately to us.
 
<i>(calls off)</i>Lucius, a bowl of wine!
 
I did not think you could have been so angry.

O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
 
Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils.
 
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
 
Ha, Portia?
 
She is dead.
 
How 'scaped I killing when I crossed you so? O insupportable and touching loss! Upon what sickness?
 
Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong-for with her death That tidings came-with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.
 
And died so?
 
Even so.
 
O ye immortal gods!

Speak no more of her.-Give me a bowl of wine.- In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.  <i>(drinks)</i>
 
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge. Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup. I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.  <i>(drinks)</i>
 
Come in, Titinius.-Welcome, good Messala! Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities.
 
Portia, art thou gone?
 
No more, I pray you. -Messala, I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
 
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
 
With what addition?
 
That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 184 --%%--
 
Therein our letters do not well agree. Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
 
Cicero one?
 
Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription.  <i>(to</i> BRUTUS<i>)</i> Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
 
No, Messala.
 
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
 
Nothing, Messala.
 
That methinks is strange.
 
Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
 
No, my lord.
 
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
 
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell. For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
 
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.
 
Even so great men great losses should endure.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 186 --%%--
 
I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so.
 
Well, to our work alive. What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?
 
I do not think it good.
 
Your reason?
 
This it is: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us. So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
 
Good reasons must of force give place to better. The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution. The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back.
 
Hear me, good brother-
 
Under your pardon. You must note beside, That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day. We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures.

Then, with your will, go on. We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
 
The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest. There is no more to say?
 
No more. Good night. Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

Farewell, good Messala.- Good night, Titinius.-Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose.

I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
 
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful. Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
 
Ay, my lord, an 't please you.
 
It does, my boy. I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
 
It is my duty, sir.
 
I should not urge thy duty past thy might. I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
 
I have slept, my lord, already.
 
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again. I will not hold thee long. If I do live, I will be good to thee.
 
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber, Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music?-Gentle knave, good night. I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee. If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument. I'll take it from thee. And, good boy, good night. -Let me see, let me see. Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.

Now, Antony, our hopes are answered. You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions. It proves not so. Their battles are at hand. They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.
 
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it. They could be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage. But 'tis not so.
 
Prepare you, generals. The enemy comes on in gallant show. Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately.
 
Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the even field.
 
Upon the right hand I. Keep thou the left.
 
Why do you cross me in this exigent?

Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk.
 
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
 
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge. Make forth. The generals would have some words.
 
<i>(to his army)</i> Stir not until the signal.
 
Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
 
Not that we love words better, as you do.
 
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
 
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words. Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart, Crying "Long live, hail, Caesar!"
 
Antony, The posture of your blows are yet unknown. But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless.

Not stingless too?
 
Oh, yes, and soundless too. For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting.
 
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar. You showed your teeth like apes, and fawned like hounds, And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet, Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
 
Flatterers?-Now, Brutus, thank yourself. This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled.
 
Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops.  <i>(draws his sword)</i> Look, I draw a sword against conspirators. When think you that the sword goes up again? Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
 
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
 
So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
 
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.

Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark! The storm is up and all is on the hazard.
 
Ho, Lucillius, hark, a word with you.

You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion. Now I change my mind, And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us. This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
 
Believe not so.
 
I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly.
 
<i>(returning with</i> LUCILLIUS<i>)</i> Even so, Lucillius.
 
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age. But since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let's reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together. What are you then determined to do?

Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself (I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life), arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below.
 
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?
 
No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun. And whether we shall meet again I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take. Forever and forever farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why, we shall smile. If not, why then this parting was well made.
 
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus. If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed. If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
 
Why then, lead on. Oh, that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come! But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.-Come, ho! Away!

O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly! Myself have to mine own turned enemy. This ensign here of mine was turning back. I slew the coward and did take it from him.  <i>(indicates his standard)</i>
 
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil, Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
 
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off. Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord. Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
 
This hill is far enough.-Look, look, Titinius. Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
 
They are, my lord.

So I am free. Yet would not so have been, Durst I have done my will. O Cassius, Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.
 
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
 
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.

No, this was he, Messala, But Cassius is no more. O setting sun, As in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight, So in his red blood Cassius' day is set. The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone. Clouds, dews, and dangers come! Our deeds are done. Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
 
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed. O hateful error, melancholy's child, Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not? O error, soon conceived, Thou never comest unto a happy birth But kill'st the mother that engendered thee!
 
What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?

Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius? Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts? Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything! But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow. Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I Will do his bidding.  <i>(lays wreath on</i> CASSIUS<i>'s head)</i> Brutus, come apace, And see how I regarded Caius Cassius. -By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part. Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.  <i>(stabs himself with</i> CASSIUS<i>'s sword and dies)</i>
 
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
 
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow.-Friends, I owe more tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay. -I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time. -Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body. His funerals shall not be in our camp, Lest it discomfort us.-Lucillius, come.- And come, young Cato.

My master's man.-Strato, where is thy master?
 
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala. The conquerors can but make a fire of him. For Brutus only overcame himself, And no man else hath honor by his death.
 
So Brutus should be found.-I thank thee, Brutus, That thou hast proved Lucillius' saying true.

This was the noblest Roman of them all. All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar. He only in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them. His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, "This was a man."

A credulous father, and a brother noble- Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy. I see the business. Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit. All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool?
 
Ay, madam.
 
By day and night he wrongs me. Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it. His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle. When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him. Say I am sick. If you come slack of former services, You shall do well. The fault of it I'll answer.
 
He's coming, madam. I hear him.
 
Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellow servants. I'll have it come to question. If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, Not to be overruled. Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away! Now by my life, Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused. Remember what I have said.
 
Very well, madam.

And let his knights have colder looks among you. What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so. I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister To hold my very course. Go, prepare for dinner.

If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech diffuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest, Shall find thee full of labors.
 
Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready.
 
<i>(to</i> KENT<i>)</i> How now, what art thou?
 
A man, sir.
 
What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
 
I do profess to be no less than I seem-to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.
 
What art thou?
 
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
 
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou'rt poor enough. What wouldst thou?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 48 --%%--
 
Service.
 
Who wouldst thou serve?
 
You.
 
Dost thou know me, fellow?
 
No, sir. But you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.
 
What's that?
 
Authority.
 
What services canst thou do?
 
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in. And the best of me is diligence.
 
How old art thou?
 
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty- eight.
 
Follow me. Thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.-Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave, my fool?-Go you, and call my fool hither.

He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
 
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
 
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.
 
He would not?
 
My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.
 
Ha! Sayest thou so?
 
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken-for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.

Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away.
 
No more of that. I have noted it well. Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.
 
Go you, call hither my fool.

My lady's father.

Why, Fool?
 
Why? For taking one's part that's out of favor. Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly. There, take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow has banished two on 's daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.-How now, nuncle?

Truth's a dog that must to kennel. He must be whipped out, when Lady Brach may stand by th' fire and stink.
 
A pestilent gall to me!
 
Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
 
Do.
 
Mark it, nuncle. Have more than thou showest, Speak less than thou knowest, Lend less than thou owest, Ride more than thou goest, Learn more than thou trowest, Set less than thou throwest, Leave thy drink and thy whore And keep in-a-door, And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score.
 
This is nothing, Fool.
 
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer. You gave me nothing for 't.-Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.

A bitter fool.
 
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?
 
No, lad. Teach me.
 
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me. Do thou for him stand. The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear- The one in motley here, The other found out there.
 
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
 
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with.
 
This is not altogether fool, my lord.
 
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me. If I had a monopoly out, they would have part on 't. And ladies too- they will not let me have all fool to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.

What two crowns shall they be?
 
Why-after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat-the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i' th' middle, and gavest away both parts, thou borest thy ass o' th' back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.    <i>(sings)</i>     <i>Fools had ne'er less wit in a year,</i>     <i>For wise men are grown foppish.</i>     <i>They know not how their wits to wear,</i>     <i>Their manners are so apish.</i>
 
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
 
I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers. For when thou gavest them the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,    <i>(sings)</i>     <i>Then they for sudden joy did weep</i>     <i>And I for sorrow sung,</i>     <i>That such a king should play bo-peep</i>     <i>And go the fools among.</i>    Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie.
 
An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool. And yet I would not be thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.
 
How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.
 
<i>(to</i> LEAR<i>)</i> Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now. I am a fool.

Mum, mum,  He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,  Weary of all, shall want some.    <i>(indicates</i> LEAR<i>)</i> That's a shelled peascod.
 
<i>(to</i> LEAR<i>)</i> Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool, But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, I had thought by making this well known unto you To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful By what yourself too late have spoke and done That you protect this course and put it on By your allowance-which if you should, the fault Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep Which in the tender of a wholesome weal Might in their working do you that offense,

Come, sir, I would you would make use of that good wisdom Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away These dispositions that of late transform you From what you rightly are.
 
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
 
Does any here know me? Why, this is not Lear. Doth Lear walk thus? Speak thus? Where are his eyes? Either his notion weakens, or his discernings Are lethargied. Ha, sleeping or waking? Sure, 'tis not so. Who is it that can tell me who I am?
 
Lear's shadow.

Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, Men so disordered, so debauched and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy. Be then desired By her that else will take the thing she begs, A little to disquantity your train, And the remainder that shall still depend To be such men as may besort your age, Which know themselves and you.
 
Darkness and devils! Saddle my horses. Call my train together.- Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee. Yet have I left a daughter.

Dry up in her the organs of increase, And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her.

Sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion, With his prepared sword he charges home My unprovided body, latched mine arm. And when he saw my best alarumed spirits, Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter, Or whether ghasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.

No. What I should deny- As this I would, ay, though thou didst produce My very character-I'd turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice.

Such smiling rogues as these, Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain Which are too intrinse t' unloose, smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel, Bring oil to fire, snow to the colder moods; Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters, Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.- A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smile you my speeches as I were a fool? Goose, an I had you upon Sarum plain, I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
 
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave.
 
Why dost thou call him "knave"? What's his offense?
 
His countenance likes me not.
 
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
 
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain. I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant.

This is some fellow, Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he. An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth. An they will take it, so. If not, he's plain. These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends Than twenty silly-ducking observants That stretch their duties nicely.
 
Sir, in good faith, or in sincere verity, Under th' allowance of your great aspect, Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus' front-
 
What mean'st by this?
 
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to 't.
 
<i>(to</i> OSWALD<i>)</i> What was th' offense you gave him?
 
I never gave him any. It pleased the king his master very late To strike at me upon his misconstruction When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure, Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed, And put upon him such a deal of man That worthied him, got praises of the king For him attempting who was self-subdued. And in the fleshment of this dread exploit Drew on me here again.

My lord, when at their home I did commend your highness' letters to them. Ere I was risen from the place that showed My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations, Delivered letters spite of intermission, Which presently they read, on whose contents They summoned up their meiny, straight took horse, Commanded me to follow and attend The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks. And meeting here the other messenger, Whose welcome I perceived had poisoned mine- Being the very fellow which of late Displayed so saucily against your highness- Having more man than wit about me, drew. He raised the house with loud and coward cries. Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers.

Oh, I have ta'en Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp. Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just.

Away! The foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Hum! Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
 
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?
 
Who gives any thing to Poor Tom, whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlipool, o'er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting- horse over four-inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor? Bless thy five wits. Tom's a-cold. Oh, do-de, do-de, do-de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do Poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now-and there-and there again-and there.
 
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?- Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give 'em all?
 
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
 
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

Take heed o' th' foul fiend. Obey thy parents, keep thy word's justice, swear not, commit not with man's sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom's a- cold.
 
What hast thou been?
 
A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her, swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven-one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand-hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind, says, "Suum, mun, nonny." Dauphin my boy, my boy, cessez. Let him trot by.

Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
 
Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence, And now and then an ample tear trilled down Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o'er her.
 
O, then it moved her?
 
Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest. You have seen Sunshine and rain at once-her smiles and tears Were like a better way. Those happy smilets That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it.

Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of "father" Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart, Cried, "Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters! Kent, father, sisters! What, i' th' storm, i' th' night? Let pity not be believed." There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamor moistened. Then away she started To deal with grief alone.
 
It is the stars, The stars above us, govern our conditions. Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town, Who sometime in his better tune remembers What we are come about, and by no means Will yield to see his daughter.

I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.
 
Sir, I thought it fit To send the old and miserable king To some retention and appointed guard- Whose age has charms in it, whose title more- To pluck the common bosom on his side, An turn our impressed lances in our eyes Which do command them. With him I sent the queen, My reason all the same, and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t' appear Where you shall hold your session. At this time We sweat and bleed. The friend hath lost his friend, And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed By those that feel their sharpness. The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place.
 
I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother.
 
That's as we list to grace him. Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers, Bore the commission of my place and person- The which immediacy may well stand up And call itself your brother.

But all's too weak, For brave Macbeth-well he deserves that name- Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel, Which smoked with bloody execution, Like valor's minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave; Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops, And fixed his head upon our battlements.

Thou'ld'st have, great Glamis, That which cries, "Thus thou must do," if thou have it, And that which rather thou dost fear to do, Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither, That I may pour my spirits in thine ear And chastise with the valor of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round, Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crowned withal.

What is your tidings?
 
The king comes here tonight.
 
Thou 'rt mad to say it. Is not thy master with him, who, were 't so, Would have informed for preparation?
 
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming. One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message.
 
Give him tending. He brings great news.
 
The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements. Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood. Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief. Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry "Hold, hold!"

Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor, Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter, Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now The future in the instant.
 
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.
 
And when goes hence?
 
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
 
O, never Shall sun that morrow see! Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters. To beguile the time, Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue. Look like th' innocent flower, But be the serpent under 't. He that's coming Must be provided for; and you shall put This night's great business into my dispatch, Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
 
We will speak further.
 
Only look up clear. To alter favor ever is to fear. Leave all the rest to me.

This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
 
This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle. Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate.
 
See, see, our honored hostess! The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble.
 
All our service, In every point twice done and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house. For those of old, And the late dignities heaped up to them, We rest your hermits.

Where's the thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor; but he rides well, And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight.
 
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.
 
Give me your hand. Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess.

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly. If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'd jump the life to come. But in these cases We still have judgment here, that we but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return To plague th' inventor: this even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice To our own lips. He's here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking-off; And pity, like a naked newborn babe, Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on th' other.

How now! What news?
 
He has almost supped. Why have you left the chamber?
 
Hath he asked for me?
 
Know you not he has?
 
We will proceed no further in this business. He hath honored me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon.
 
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely? From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would, " Like the poor cat i' th' adage?
 
Prithee, peace: I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.
 
What beast was 't, then, That made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; And to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both. They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me. I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this.

When Duncan is asleep- Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him-his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?
 
Bring forth men-children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males. Will it not be received, When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done 't?

Give me my sword. Who's there?
 
A friend.
 
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed. He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices. This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content.

All's well. I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.
 
I think not of them. Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.
 
At your kind'st leisure.
 
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, It shall make honor for you.
 
So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear, I shall be counselled.
 
Good repose the while!
 
Thanks, sir: the like to you!
 
<i>(to the</i> SERVANT<i>)</i> Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
 
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw. Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going, And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses, Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before. There's no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings, and withered murder, Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold. What hath quenched them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it. The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die.

Alack, I am afraid they have awaked, And 'tis not done. Th' attempt and not the deed Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done 't.
 
My husband!

Hark! Who lies i' th' second chamber?

A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
 
There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried. "Murder!" That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them. But they did say their prayers, and addressed them Again to sleep.
 
There are two lodged together.
 
One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other, As they had seen me with these hangman's hands. List'ning their fear I could not say "Amen," When they did say "God bless us!"
 
Consider it not so deeply.
 
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"? I had most need of blessing, and "Amen" Stuck in my throat.
 
These deeds must not be thought After these ways. So, it will make us mad.

Methought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep"-the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care, The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast.
 
What do you mean?
 
Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house. "Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more."
 
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there. Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.
 
I'll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on 't again I dare not.
 
Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. 'Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.

My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white.
 
I hear a knocking At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed. How easy is it, then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended.
 
Hark! More knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.

Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
 
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?
 
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock. And drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
 
What three things does drink especially provoke?
 
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
 
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

That it did, sir, i' th' very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.
 
Is thy master stirring?
 
Our knocking has awaked him. Here he comes.
 
Good morrow, noble sir.
 
Good morrow, both.
 
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
 
Not yet.
 
He did command me to call timely on him. I have almost slipped the hour.

Oh, by whom?
 
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done 't. Their hands and faces were all badged with blood. So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows. They stared, and were distracted. No man's life was to be trusted with them.

'Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last, A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.
 
And Duncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain- Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would Make war with mankind.

To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared. 'Tis much he dares, And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety. There is none but he Whose being I do fear, and under him My genius is rebuked, as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me And bade them speak to him. Then, prophetlike, They hailed him father to a line of kings. Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown And put a barren scepter in my grip, Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so, For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered; Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come fate into the list, And champion me to th' utterance. Who's there?

And with him- To leave no rubs nor botches in the work- Fleance, his son, that keeps him company, Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father's, must embrace the fate Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart. I'll come to you anon.
 
We are resolved, my lord.
 
I'll call upon you straight. Abide within.
 
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 96 --%%--
 
Is Banquo gone from court?
 
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
 
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words.
 
Madam, I will.
 
Naught's had, all's spent, Where our desire is got without content. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
 
How now, my lord! Why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard. What's done is done.
 
We have scorched the snake, not killed it. She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave. After life's fitful fever he sleeps well. Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.

Come on, gentle my lord, Sleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial Among your guests tonight.
 
So shall I, love, And so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance Apply to Banquo; present him eminence, Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are.
 
You must leave this.
 
Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
 
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
 
There's comfort yet; they are assailable. Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate's summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.
 
What's to be done?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 100 --%%--
 
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crow Makes wing to th' rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvel'st at my words: but hold thee still. Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me.

Hark, I hear horses.

Then 'tis he: the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' th' court.

You know your own degrees; sit down. At first And last, the hearty welcome.
 
Thanks to your majesty.
 
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time We will require her welcome.
 
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, For my heart speaks they are welcome.
 
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks. Both sides are even. Here I'll sit i' th' midst. Be large in mirth. Anon we'll drink a measure The table round.
 
<i>(aside to</i> FIRST MURDERER<i>)</i> There's blood upon thy face.
 
'Tis Banquo's then.
 
'Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatched?

My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.
 
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats: Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.
 
Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.
 
Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air. But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in To saucy doubts and fears.-But Banquo's safe?
 
Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head, The least a death to nature.
 
Thanks for that. There the grown serpent lies. The worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed; No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again.
 
My royal lord, You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold That is not often vouched, while 'tis a-making, 'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.

His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please 't your highness To grace us with your royal company?

Here is a place reserved, sir.

Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat. The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion. Feed and regard him not. <i>(aside to</i> MACBETH<i>)</i> Are you a man?
 
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appall the devil.
 
O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear. This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan. Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire, Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all's done, You look but on a stool.
 
Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too. If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites.

Blood hath been shed ere now, i' th' olden time, Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been performed Too terrible for the ear. The time has been That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end. But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools. This is more strange Than such a murder is.
 
My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.
 
I do forget. Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all. Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine. Fill full.
 
I drink to the general joy o' th' whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; Would he were here! To all and him we thirst, And all to all.

What man dare, I dare. Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble. Or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword. If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence!

You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder.
 
Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine is blanched with fear.

It will have blood, they say. Blood will have blood. Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak. Augurs and understood relations have By magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret'st man of blood.-What is the night?
 
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
 
How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding?
 
Did you send to him, sir?
 
I hear it by the way; but I will send. There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd. I will tomorrow- And betimes I will-to the weird sisters. More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way. I am in blood Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er. Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.

And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now. Get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i' th' morning. Thither he Will come to know his destiny. Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and everything beside. I am for the air. This night I'll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end. Great business must be wrought ere noon. Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound. I'll catch it ere it come to ground.

My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, Which can interpret farther. Only I say Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead. And the right-valiant Banquo walked too late, Whom, you may say, if 't please you, Fleance killed, For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? Damned fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too, For 'twould have angered any heart alive To hear the men deny 't. So that, I say, He has borne all things well. And I do think That had he Duncan's sons under his key- As, an't please heaven, he shall not-they should find What 'twere to kill a father. So should Fleance. But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he failed His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself?
 
The son of Duncan- From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth- Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward, That by the help of these-with Him above To ratify the work-we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage and receive free honors. All which we pine for now. And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 128 --%%--
 
Sent he to Macduff?
 
He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I," The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say "You'll rue the time That clogs me with this answer."
 
And that well might Advise him to a caution, t' hold what distance His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed!
 
I'll send my prayers with him.

Wisdom! To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly? He loves us not; He wants the natural touch. For the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear and nothing is the love, As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason.
 
My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself. But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o' th' season.

What I believe I'll wail; What know believe, and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. What you have spoke, it may be so perchance. This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest. You have loved him well. He hath not touched you yet.

Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeered.-Fare thee well, lord. I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp, And the rich East to boot.
 
Be not offended. I speak not as in absolute fear of you. I think our country sinks beneath the yoke. It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds. I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands. But, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed.

This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will, Of your mere own. All these are portable, With other graces weighed.
 
But I have none. The king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth.
 
O Scotland, Scotland!
 
If such a one be fit to govern, speak. I am as I have spoken.

Fit to govern? No, not to live.-O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed, And does blaspheme his breed?-Thy royal father Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee, Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived. Fare thee well! These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself Have banished me from Scotland.-O my breast, Thy hope ends here!
 
Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From overcredulous haste. But God above Deal between thee and me, for even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature. I am yet Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, At no time broke my faith, would not betray The devil to his fellow, and delight No less in truth than life. My first false speaking Was this upon myself. What I am truly, Is thine and my poor country's to command.

Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth. Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
 
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile.
 
Well, more anon.-Comes the king forth, I pray you?
 
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure. Their malady convinces The great assay of art, but at his touch- Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand- They presently amend.
 
I thank you, doctor.
 
What's the disease he means?
 
'Tis called the evil. A most miraculous work in this good king, Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, Himself best knows, but strangely visited people, All swoll'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he cures, Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, Put on with holy prayers. And, 'tis spoken,

My countryman, but yet I know him not.
 
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
 
I know him now.-Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers!
 
Sir, amen.
 
Stands Scotland where it did?
 
Alas, poor country! Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell Is there scarce asked for who, and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or ere they sicken.

And all my children?
 
Well too.
 
The tyrant has not battered at their peace?
 
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
 
Be not a niggard of your speech. How goes 't?
 
When I came hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor Of many worthy fellows that were out; Which was to my belief witnessed the rather For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot. Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses.

What concern they? The general cause, or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast?
 
No mind that's honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone.
 
If it be mine, Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.
 
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard.
 
Hum! I guess at it.
 
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner, Were, on the quarry of these murdered deer To add the death of you.
 
Merciful heaven! What, man! Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows. Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.

Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.

Dispute it like a man.
 
I shall do so, But I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on, And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.
 
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart, enrage it.
 
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission. Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself. Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, Heaven forgive him too.

I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
 
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
 
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the line>effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
 
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
 
You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.
 
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.

It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
 
Yet here's a spot.
 
Hark! She speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
 
Out, damned spot! Out, I say!-One, two. Why, then, 'tis time to do 't. Hell is murky!-Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?-Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.
 
Do you mark that?
 
The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?-What, will these hands ne'er be clean?-No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting.

What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
 
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
 
Well, well, well.
 
Pray God it be, sir.
 
This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
 
Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Look not so pale.-I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on 's grave.
 
Even so?

Foul whisp'rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician.

Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
 
For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file Of all the gentry. There is Siward's son, And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood.

Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies. Some say he's mad, others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury. But, for certain, He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule.
 
Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands. Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach. Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe Upon a dwarfish thief.

Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.

Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do 't.

Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster, Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio- I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks- There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a willful stillness entertain With purpose to be dressed in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, "I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!" O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing, when I am very sure If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.

Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promised to tell me of?

--%%-- pageNum: 12 --%%--
 
Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love, And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
 
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it. And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honor, be assured My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions.
 
In my school days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth-and by adventuring both, I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a willful youth, That which I owe is lost. But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
 
You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance. And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am pressed unto it. Therefore speak.

In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair and-fairer than that word- Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages. Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand, And many Jasons come in quest of her. O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate!
 
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea. Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum. Therefore go forth, Try what my credit can in Venice do- That shall be racked even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia. Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake.

By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.
 
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.
 
Good sentences, and well pronounced.
 
They would be better if well followed.
 
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree. Such a hare is madness the youth-to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word "choose!" I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike-so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
 
I pray thee, overname them. And as thou namest them, I will describe them. And according to my description, level at my affection.
 
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
 
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith.
 
Then there is the County Palatine.
 
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, "An you will not have me, choose." He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!
 
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 20 --%%--
 
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!-why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a- capering. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness I shall never requite him.
 
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?
 
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man's picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
 
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?
 
That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another.

How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
 
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk. When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
 
If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father's will if you should refuse to accept him.
 
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do any thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
 
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition depending on the caskets.
 
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.
 
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 24 --%%--
 
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio-as I think he was so called.
 
True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
 
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
 
How now, what news?
 
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight.
 
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa.-<i>(to</i> SERVANT<i>)</i> Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer Another knocks at the door.

For three months, well.
 
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
 
Antonio shall become bound, well.
 
May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?
 
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
 
Your answer to that?
 
Antonio is a good man.
 
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
 
Ho, no, no, no, no. My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition. He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.

I will be assured I may, and that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
 
If it please you to dine with us.
 
Yes-to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
 
This is Signor Antonio.

I hate him for he is a Christian, But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice.

When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep- This Jacob from our holy Abram was, As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor, ay, he was the third-
 
And what of him? Did he take interest?
 
No, not take interest-not as you would say Directly interest. Mark what Jacob did: When Laban and himself were compromised That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank, In the end of autumn turned to the rams. And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act, The skillful shepherd peeled me certain wands. And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall parti-colored lambs-and those were Jacob's. This was a way to thrive, and he was blessed. And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
 
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for- A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven. Was this inserted to make interest good? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
 
I cannot tell: I make it breed as fast. But note me, signor-

Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart. Oh, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
 
Three thousand ducats-'tis a good round sum. Three months from twelve, then. Let me see. The rate-
 
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
 
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances. Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe. You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine- And all for use of that which is mine own. Well then, it now appears you need my help. Go to, then! You come to me and you say, "Shylock, we would have moneys." You say so!- You, that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold! Moneys is your suit. What should I say to you? Should I not say, "Hath a dog money? Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?" Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this:
 
--%%-- pageNum: 36 --%%--
 
"Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last; You spurned me such a day; another time You called me 'dog'-and for these courtesies I'll lend you thus much moneys?"
 
I am as like to call thee so again, To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too. If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends, for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend? But lend it rather to thine enemy, Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.
 
Why, look you how you storm! I would be friends with you and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stained me with, Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys-and you'll not hear me! This is kind I offer.
 
This were kindness.
 
This kindness will I show. Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond, and-in a merry sport- If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me.
 
Content, in faith. I'll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

You shall not seal to such a bond for me! I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
 
Why, fear not, man. I will not forfeit it. Within these two months-that's a month before This bond expires-I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
 
O Father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others!-Pray you, tell me this: If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man's flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favor I extend this friendship. If he will take it, so. If not, adieu. And for my love I pray you wrong me not.
 
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
 
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's. Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I will be with you.
 
Hie thee, gentle Jew.

In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden's eyes. Besides, the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.

But, alas the while! If Hercules and Lychas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand. So is Alcides beaten by his page, And so may I, blind fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain And die with grieving.
 
You must take your chance, And either not attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage. Therefore be advised.
 
Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
 
First, forward to the temple. After dinner Your hazard shall be made.

Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master.

Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, "My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son"-or rather an honest woman's son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to. He had a kind of taste.-Well, my conscience says, "Launcelot, budge not." "Budge!" says the fiend. "Budge not," says my conscience. "Conscience," say I, "you counsel well." "Fiend," say I, "you counsel well." To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil. And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation. And in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend.

I know the hand. In faith, 'tis a fair hand, And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ.
 
Love news, in faith?
 
<i>(to</i> LORENZO<i>)</i> By your leave, sir.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 68 --%%--
 
Whither goest thou?
 
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.
 
<i>(giving</i> LAUNCELOT <i>money)</i>  Hold here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her. Speak it privately.- Go, gentlemen, Will you prepare you for this masque tonight? I am provided of a torchbearer.
 
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
 
And so will I.
 
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
 
'Tis good we do so.
 
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 70 --%%--
 
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed How I shall take her from her father's house, What gold and jewels she is furnished with, What page's suit she hath in readiness. If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter's sake. And never dare Misfortune cross her foot Unless she do it under this excuse: That she is issue to a faithless Jew. Come, go with me.  <i>(gives</i> GRATIANO <i>the letter)</i>  Peruse this as thou goest. Fair Jessica shall be my torchbearer.

Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.- What, Jessica!-Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me.-What, Jessica!- And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out- Why, Jessica, I say!
 
Why, Jessica!
 
Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
 
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding.
 
Call you? What is your will?
 
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys.-But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love. They flatter me. But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian.-Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go. There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money bags tonight.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 74 --%%--
 
I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach.
 
So do I his.
 
And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i' th' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th' afternoon.
 
What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica. Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces. But stop my house's ears-I mean my casements- Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear, I have no mind of feasting forth tonight. But I will go.-Go you before me, sirrah. Say I will come.
 
I will go before, sir.- Mistress, look out at window, for all this. There will come a Christian by Will be worth a Jewess' eye.

What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
 
His words were, "Farewell, mistress." Nothing else.
 
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me. Therefore I part with him, and part with him To one that would have him help to waste His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in. Perhaps I will return immediately. Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you. Fast bind, fast find. A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
 
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand.
 
His hour is almost past.
 
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.
 
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeited.
 
That ever holds. Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down? Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first? All things that are, Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed. How like a younger or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, Hugged and embraed by the strumpet wind! How like the prodigal doth she return, With overweathered ribs and ragged sails Lean, rent, and beggared by the strumpet wind!
 
Here comes Lorenzo. More of this hereafter.

Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode. Not I but my affairs have made you wait. When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I'll watch as long for you then. Approach. Here dwells my father Jew.-Ho! Who's within?
 
Who are you? Tell me for more certainty, Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
 
Lorenzo, and thy love.
 
Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed- For who love I so much? And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
 
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
 
Here, catch this casket. It is worth the pains. I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me, For I am much ashamed of my exchange. But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit, For if they could Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boy.
 
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
 
What, must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light. Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love. And I should be obscured.

So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once, For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stayed for at Bassanio's feast.
 
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
 
Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew.
 
Beshrew me but I love her heartily. For she is wise, if I can judge of her. And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true. And true she is, as she hath proved herself. And therefore, like herself-wise, fair and true- Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
 
What, art thou come?-On, gentlemen, away! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
 
Who's there?
 
Signor Antonio?

Fie, fie, Gratiano! Where are all the rest? 'Tis nine o'clock. Our friends all stay for you. No masque tonight. The wind is come about. Bassanio presently will go aboard. I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
 
I am glad on 't. I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.

<i>(to servant)</i> Go draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince.-
 
A curtain is drawn showing a gold, silver, and lead casket
 
<i>(to</i> MOROCCO<i>)</i> Now make your choice.
 
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears: "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire." The second, silver, which this promise carries: "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt: "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." How shall I know if I do choose the right?
 
The one of them contains my picture, Prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
 
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey th' inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." Must give-for what? For lead? Hazard for lead? This casket threatens. Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages. A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross. I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue?

"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." "As much as he deserves!"-pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou beest rated by thy estimation, Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady, And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself. As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady. I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, In graces, and in qualities of breeding. But more than these, in love I do deserve. What if I strayed no further, but chose here? Let's see once more this saying graved in gold, "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire." Why, that's the lady. All the world desires her. From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint. The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia. The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia. One of these three contains her heavenly picture. Is 't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation To think so base a thought. It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. Or shall I think in silver she's immured, Being ten times undervalued to tried gold? O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold. They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold, but that's insculped upon. But here an angel in a golden bed

Lies all within.-Deliver me the key. Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
 
<i>(giving</i> MOROCCO <i>a key)</i>  There, take it, Prince. And if my form lie there Then I am yours.
 
O hell, what have we here? A carrion death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll. I'll read the writing.  <i>(reads)</i>  "All that glisters is not gold- Often have you heard that told. Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold. Gilded tombs do worms enfold. Had you been as wise as bold, Young in limbs, in judgment old, Your answer had not been inscrolled. Fare you well. Your suit is cold- Cold, indeed, and labor lost." Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost! Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave. Thus losers part.
 
A gentle riddance.-Draw the curtains, go.- Let all of his complexion choose me so.

Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail. With him is Gratiano gone along. And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
 
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
 
He came too late. The ship was under sail. But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
 
I never heard a passion so confused, So strange, outrageous, and so variable, As the dog Jew did utter in the streets. "My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter, Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter! A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter! And jewels-two stones, two rich and precious stones- Stol'n by my daughter! Justice, find the girl! She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats."
 
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, "His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!"

Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this.
 
Marry, well remembered. I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught. I thought upon Antonio when he told me, And wished in silence that it were not his.
 
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear- Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
 
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth. I saw Bassanio and Antonio part. Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return. He answered, "Do not so. Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio But stay the very riping of the time. And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love. Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there." And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio's hand. And so they parted.

Quick, quick, I pray thee. Draw the curtain straight. The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently.
 
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince. If you choose that wherein I am contained, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized. But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.
 
I am enjoined by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to any one Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone.
 
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
 
And so have I addressed me. Fortune now To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see. "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

"What many men desire"-that "many" may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; Which pries not to th' interior, but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty. I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house. Tell me once more what title thou dost bear. "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." And well said too-for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity. Oh, that estates, degrees and offices Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honor Were purchased by the merit of the wearer! How many then should cover that stand bare! How many be commanded that command! How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor! And how much honor Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times To be new varnished! Well, but to my choice. "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." I will assume desert.-Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

To offend and judge are distinct offices And of opposed natures.
 
What is here?  <i>(reads)</i>  "The fire seven times tried this, Seven times tried that judgment is, That did never choose amiss. Some there be that shadows kiss. Such have but a shadow's bliss. There be fools alive, iwis, Silvered o'er-and so was this. Take what wife you will to bed, I will ever be your head. So be gone. You are sped.

Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love. A day in April never came so sweet To show how costly summer was at hand, As this forespurrer comes before his lord.
 
No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.- Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

Now, what news on the Rialto?
 
Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas. The Goodwins I think they call the place-a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word.
 
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio-oh, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!-
 
Come, the full stop.
 
Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is he hath lost a ship.

And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged, and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
 
She is damned for it.
 
That's certain-if the devil may be her judge.
 
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
 
Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
 
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood.

There I have another bad match!-a bankrupt, a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart. Let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond.
 
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh. What's that good for?
 
To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies-and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute-and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.

Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt-the curse never fell upon our nation till now! I never felt it till now-Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear! Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so. And I know not what's spent in the search. Why thou, loss upon loss!

Nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders, no sighs but o' my breathing, no tears but o' my shedding.

I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.

Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one night fourscore ducats.
 
Thou stickest a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!
 
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
 
I am very glad of it. I'll plague him. I'll torture him. I am glad of it.
 
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.

There's something tells me-but it is not love- I would not lose you, and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality. But lest you should not understand me well- And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought- I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me. I could teach you How to choose right, but I am then forsworn. So will I never be. So may you miss me. But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, They have o'erlooked me and divided me. One half of me is yours, the other half yours- Mine own, I would say. But if mine, then yours, And so all yours. Oh, these naughty times Put bars between the owners and their rights! And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so. Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I. I speak too long, but 'tis to peize the time, To eke it and to draw it out in length, To stay you from election.

Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

"Confess and love" Had been the very sum of my confession. O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end, Fading in music. That the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And watery deathbed for him. He may win, And what is music then? Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear And summon him to marriage.

So may the outward shows be least themselves. The world is still deceived with ornament. In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt But, being seasoned with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil? In religion, What damned error, but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament? There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts. How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars, Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk, And these assume but valor's excrement To render them redoubted. Look on beauty, And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight, Which therein works a miracle in nature, Making them lightest that wear most of it. So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulcher. Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty-in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. Therefore then, thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee. Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge 'Tween man and man. But thou, thou meagre lead, Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught, Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence, And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!

Here in her hairs, The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes- How could he see to do them? Having made one, Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnished. Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it, so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll, The continent and summary of my fortune.  <i>(reads)</i>  "You that choose not by the view, Chance as fair and choose as true.

You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand Such as I am. Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself- A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich- That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends Exceed account. But the full sum of me Is sum of something which, to term in gross, Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpracticed; Happy in this-she is not yet so old But she may learn. Happier than this- She is not bred so dull but she can learn. Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord, her governor, her king. Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted. But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself. And even now, but now, This house, these servants, and this same myself Are yours, my lord's. I give them with this ring, Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love

And be my vantage to exclaim on you.  <i>(gives</i> BASSANIO <i>a ring)</i>
 
Madam, you have bereft me of all words. Only my blood speaks to you in my veins. And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude, Where every something, being blent together, Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy, Expressed and not expressed. But when this ring Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence. O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
 
My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, "Good joy, good joy, my lord and lady!"
 
My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish, For I am sure you can wish none from me. And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.
 
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
 
I thank your lordship, you have got me one. My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours. You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid. You loved, I loved. For intermission No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. Your fortune stood upon the casket there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls. For wooing here until I sweat again, And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last-if promise last- I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love, provided that your fortune Achieved her mistress.

I did, my lord. And I have reason for it. Signor Antonio Commends him to you.  <i>(gives</i> BASSANIO <i>letter)</i>

There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio's cheek. Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?- With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you.
 
O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you, all the wealth I had Ran in my veins. I was a gentleman, And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady, Rating myself at nothing, you shall see How much I was a braggart. When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing, for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend, Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady, The paper as the body of my friend, And every word in it a gaping wound, Issuing life blood.-But is it true, Salerio? Have all his ventures failed? What, not one hit? From Tripolis, from Mexico and England, From Lisbon, Barbary, and India? And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch Of merchant-marring rocks?

Not one, my lord. Besides, it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it. Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man. He plies the duke at morning and at night, And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, The duke himself, and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him. But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
 
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him. And I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power deny not, It will go hard with poor Antonio.
 
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
 
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best conditioned and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies, and one in whom The ancient Roman honor more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy.
 
What sum owes he the Jew?
 
For me, three thousand ducats.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 140 --%%--
 
What, no more? Pay him six thousand and deface the bond! Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault. First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend. For never shall you lie by Portia's side With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over. When it is paid, bring your true friend along. My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! For you shall hence upon your wedding day. Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer. Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. But let me hear the letter of your friend.
 
<i>(reads)</i>  "Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried. My creditors grow cruel. My estate is very low. My bond to the Jew is forfeit. And since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter."
 
O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
 
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste. But till I come again, No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

The duke shall grant me justice.-I do wonder, Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request.
 
I pray thee, hear me speak.
 
I'll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I'll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head, relent and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not. I'll have no speaking. I will have my bond.

I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
 
The duke cannot deny the course of law. For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice, if it be denied, Will much impeach the justice of his state, Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go. These griefs and losses have so bated me, That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.- Well, jailer, on.-Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.

Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord. But if you knew to whom you show this honor, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you.
 
I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit, Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord. If it be so, How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty! This comes too near the praising of myself. Therefore no more of it.

Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children. Therefore I promise ye I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be o' good cheer, for truly I think you are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.
 
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
 
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
 
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed. So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.

His name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o'er many books together. He is furnished with my opinion, which-bettered with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend-comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace's request in my stead.I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.

On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
 
The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest. It becomes The throned monarch better than his crown. His scepter shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings, But mercy is above this sceptered sway. It is enthroned in the hearts of kings. It is an attribute to God himself. And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,

Yes, here I tender it for him in the court- Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.

I have a wife, whom I protest I love. I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
 
'Tis well you offer it behind her back. The wish would make else an unquiet house.

These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter. Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband rather than a Christian!- We trifle time. I pray thee, pursue sentence.
 
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine. The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
 
Most rightful judge!
 
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast. The law allows it, and the court awards it.
 
Most learned judge, a sentence! Come, prepare.
 
Tarry a little. There is something else. This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood. The words expressly are "a pound of flesh." Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice.
 
O upright judge!-Mark, Jew.-O learned judge!
 
Is that the law?
 
Thyself shalt see the act. For as thou urgest justice, be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.

O learned judge!-Mark, Jew, a learned judge!
 
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go.
 
Here is the money.
 
Soft! The Jew shall have all justice. Soft, no haste. He shall have nothing but the penalty.
 
O Jew! An upright judge, a learned judge!
 
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh. If thou takest more Or less than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple-nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
 
A second Daniel!-A Daniel, Jew! Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
 
Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
 
Give me my principal, and let me go.
 
I have it ready for thee. Here it is.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 190 --%%--
 
He hath refused it in the open court. He shall have merely justice and his bond.
 
A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!- I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
 
Shall I not have barely my principal?
 
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
 
Why then, the devil give him good of it! I'll stay no longer question.
 
Tarry, Jew. The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods. The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state, And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice. In which predicament I say thou stand'st, For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly-and directly too- Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant, and thou hast incurred The danger formerly by me rehearsed. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 192 --%%--
 
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself, And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, Thou hast not left the value of a cord. Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge.
 
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it. For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's. The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
 
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
 
Nay, take my life and all. Pardon not that. You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house. You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live.
 
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
 
A halter gratis, nothing else, for God's sake.
 
So please my lord the duke and all the court, To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter. Two things provided more: that for this favor He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift Here in the court, of all he dies possessed, Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

He shall do this, or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here.

I am content.

He is well paid that is well satisfied. And I, delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid. My mind was never yet more mercenary. I pray you, know me when we meet again. I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
 
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further. Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, Not as a fee. Grant me two things, I pray you: Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
 
You press me far and therefore I will yield.  <i>(to</i> ANTONIO<i>)</i>  Give me your gloves. I'll wear them for your sake.  <i>(to</i> BASSANIO<i>)</i>  And for your love, I'll take this ring from you. Do not draw back your hand. I'll take no more, And you in love shall not deny me this.
 
This ring, good sir-alas, it is a trifle. I will not shame myself to give you this.
 
I will have nothing else but only this. And now methinks I have a mind to it.

There's more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation. Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
 
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers. You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered.
 
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife. And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
 
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts. An if your wife be not a madwoman, And know how well I have deserved the ring, She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you.
 
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued against your wife's commandment.

That cannot be. His ring I do accept most thankfully. And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.
 
That will I do.

A friend.
 
A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
 
Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours.
 
Who comes with her?

None but a holy hermit and her maid. I pray you, is my master yet returned?
 
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.- But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
 
Sola, sola! Wo, ha, ho! Sola, sola!
 
Who calls?
 
Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
 
Leave holloaing, man. Here.
 
Sola! Where, where?

Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news. My master will be here ere morning.
 
Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming. And yet no matter. Why should we go in?- My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand. And bring your music forth into the air.

How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears. Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold. There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings, Still choiring to the young-eyed cherubins. Such harmony is in immortal souls, But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
 
Come ho, and wake Diana with a hymn! With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, And draw her home with music.
 
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
 
The reason is your spirits are attentive. For do but note a wild and wanton herd, Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood- If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music.

Therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils. The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus. Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
 
That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
 
When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
 
So doth the greater glory dim the less. A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music, hark.
 
It is your music, madam, of the house.
 
Nothing is good, I see, without respect. Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
 
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
 
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended, and I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection! Peace! How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked.

<i>(to</i> NERISSA<i>)</i> By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong. In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk. Would he were gelt that had it, for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
 
A quarrel, ho, already? What's the matter?
 
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler's poetry Upon a knife, "Love me and leave me not."
 
What talk you of the posy or the value? You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave. Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective and have kept it. Gave it a judge's clerk! No, God's my judge. The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it.
 
He will, an if he live to be a man.
 
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
 
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk, A prating boy that begged it as a fee. I could not for my heart deny it him.
 
You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife's first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 220 --%%--
 
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it. And here he stands. I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters. Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief. An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
 
<i>(aside)</i> Why, I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it.
 
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too. And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begged mine. And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.
 
What ring gave you my lord? Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
 
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it. but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone.
 
Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed Until I see the ring.
 
<i>(to</i> GRATIANO<i>)</i>  Nor I in yours Till I again see mine.

Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
 
If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honor to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleased to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe. I'll die for 't but some woman had the ring.
 
No, by my honor, madam, by my soul, No woman had it but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And begged the ring, the which I did deny him And suffered him to go displeased away- Even he that did uphold the very life Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady? I was enforced to send it after him. I was beset with shame and courtesy. My honor would not let ingratitude So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady, For by these blessed candles of the night, Had you been there I think you would have begged The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

Let not that doctor e'er come near my house! Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you. I'll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband's bed. Know him I shall, I am well sure of it. Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus. If you do not, if I be left alone, Now, by mine honor-which is yet mine own- I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
 
<i>(to</i> GRATIANO<i>)</i> And I his clerk. Therefore be well advised How you do leave me to mine own protection.
 
Well, do you so, let not me take him then. For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
 
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
 
Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.
 
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself-
 
Mark you but that! In both my eyes he doubly sees himself- In each eye, one. Swear by your double self, And there's an oath of credit!

Nay, but hear me. Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.
 
I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which but for him that had your husband's ring Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again, My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly.
 
<i>(giving</i> ANTONIO <i>a ring)</i>  Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other.
 
<i>(giving</i> BASSANIO PORTIA'<i>s ring)</i>  Here, Lord Bassanio. Swear to keep this ring.
 
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

Thanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee?
 
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia.- Stand forth, Demetrius.-My noble lord, This man hath my consent to marry her.- Stand forth, Lysander.-And my gracious duke, This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.- Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, And interchanged love tokens with my child. Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love, And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats-messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth. With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart, Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness.-And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens. As she is mine, I may dispose of her- Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death-according to our law Immediately provided in that case.
 
What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid: To you your father should be as a god, One that composed your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax, By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

So is Lysander.
 
In himself he is. But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other must be held the worthier.
 
I would my father looked but with my eyes.
 
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
 
I do entreat your grace to pardon me. I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts, But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
 
Either to die the death or to abjure Forever the society of men. Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires. Know of your youth. Examine well your blood- Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mewed, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon. Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage. But earthlier happy is the rose distilled Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn, Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.

So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
 
Take time to pause, and by the next new moon- The sealing day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship- Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would, Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life.
 
Relent, sweet Hermia-And, Lysander, yield Thy crazed title to my certain right.
 
You have her father's love, Demetrius. Let me have Hermia's. Do you marry him.
 
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love, And what is mine my love shall render him. And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.
 
<i>(to</i> THESEUS<i>)</i> I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possessed. My love is more than his. My fortunes every way as fairly ranked, (If not with vantage) as Demetrius'. And-which is more than all these boasts can be- I am beloved of beauteous Hermia. Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, And won her soul. And she, sweet lady, dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

I have some private schooling for you both.- For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father's will, Or else the law of Athens yields you up (Which by no means we may extenuate) To death, or to a vow of single life.- Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?- Demetrius and Egeus, go along. I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
 
With duty and desire we follow you.
 
How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale? How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
 
Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

Or else misgraffed in respect of years-
 
O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.
 
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
 
O hell, to choose love by another's eyes!
 
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentary as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night; That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth, And ere a man hath power to say "Behold!" The jaws of darkness do devour it up. So quick bright things come to confusion.
 
If then true lovers have been ever crossed, It stands as an edict in destiny. Then let us teach our trial patience, Because it is a customary cross, As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
 
A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia. I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child. From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, And she respects me as her only son. There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee. And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then, Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night. And in the wood, a league without the town-

Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May- There will I stay for thee.
 
My good Lysander! I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke (In number more than ever women spoke), In that same place thou hast appointed me, Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
 
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
 
Godspeed, fair Helena! Whither away?
 
Call you me "fair"? That "fair" again unsay. Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair! Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue's sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. Sickness is catching. Oh, were favor so, Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go. My ear should catch your voice. My eye, your eye. My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody. Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 16 --%%--
 
O, teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
 
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
 
Oh, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
 
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
 
Oh, that my prayers could such affection move!
 
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
 
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
 
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
 
None, but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!
 
Take comfort. He no more shall see my face. Lysander and myself will fly this place. Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me. Oh, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
 
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold. Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass, Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass (A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal), Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
 
<i>(to</i> HELENA<i>)</i> And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie, Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,

There my Lysander and myself shall meet. And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies. Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us. And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!- Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
 
I will, my Hermia.
 
Helena, adieu. As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
 
How happy some o'er other some can be! Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so. He will not know what all but he do know. And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities. Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste- Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste. And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjured everywhere. For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne, He hailed down oaths that he was only mine.

And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight. Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her. And for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense. But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again.

Is all our company here?
 
You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
 
Here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his wedding day at night.
 
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.
 
Marry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most <i>cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe</i>.
 
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.-Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.-Masters, spread yourselves.
 
Answer as I call you.-Nick Bottom, the weaver?
 
Ready. Name what part I am for and proceed.
 
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

A lover that kills himself, most gallant, for love.
 
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms. I will condole in some measure.-To the rest.-Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in to make all split. <i>The raging rocks</i>  <i>And shivering shocks</i>  <i>Shall break the locks</i>  <i>Of prison gates</i>. <i>And Phoebus' car</i>  <i>Shall shine from far</i>  <i>And make and mar</i>  <i>The foolish Fates</i>. This was lofty!-Now name the rest of the players.-This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein. A lover is more condoling.
 
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender?
 
Here, Peter Quince.
 
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 26 --%%--
 
What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?
 
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
 
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman. I have a beard coming.
 
That's all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
 
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too! I'll speak in a monstrous little voice: "Thisne, Thisne!"-"Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear, thy Thisbe dear and lady dear!"
 
No, no. You must play Pyramus.-And Flute, you Thisbe.
 
Well, proceed.
 
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
 
Here, Peter Quince.
 
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe's mother.-Tom Snout, the tinker?
 
Here, Peter Quince.
 
You, Pyramus' father.-Myself, Thisbe's father.-Snug the joiner, you, the lion's part.-And I hope here is a play fitted.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 28 --%%--
 
Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
 
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
 
Let me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the duke say, "Let him roar again. Let him roar again."
 
An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek. And that were enough to hang us all.
 
That would hang us, every mother's son.
 
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove. I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.
 
You can play no part but Pyramus. For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day, a most lovely, gentlemanlike man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
 
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?
 
Why, what you will.

I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French crown-color beard, your perfect yellow.
 
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play barefaced.-But masters, here are your parts. And I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.
 
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be perfect. Adieu.
 
At the duke's oak we meet.
 
Enough. Hold, or cut bowstrings.

How now, spirit? Whither wander you?
 
Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire. I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon's sphere. And I serve the fairy queen To dew her orbs upon the green. The cowslips tall her pensioners be. In their gold coats spots you see. Those be rubies, fairy favors. In those freckles live their savors. I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. Farewell, thou lob of spirits. I'll be gone. Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
 
The king doth keep his revels here tonight. Take heed the queen come not within his sight. For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she, as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king. She never had so sweet a changeling. And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild. But she perforce withholds the loved boy, Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.

And now they never meet in grove or green, By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen. But they do square, that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.
 
Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery, Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn, And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? Those that "Hobgoblin" call you, and "sweet Puck," You do their work, and they shall have good luck. Are not you he?
 
Thou speak'st aright. I am that merry wanderer of the night. I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal. And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab, And when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale. The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me. Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And "Tailor!" cries, and falls into a cough, And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there. But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.
 
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
 
What, jealous Oberon?-Fairies, skip hence. I have forsworn his bed and company.
 
Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?
 
Then I must be thy lady. But I know When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland, And in the shape of Corin sat all day, Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here, Come from the farthest step of India? But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity.
 
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna, whom he ravished? And make him with fair &AElig;gles break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa?

These are the forgeries of jealousy. And never, since the middle summer's spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By paved fountain, or by rushy brook, Or in the beached margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport. Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs, which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents. The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard. The fold stands empty in the drowned field, And crows are fatted with the murrain flock. The nine-men's-morris is filled up with mud, And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable. The human mortals want their winter here. No night is now with hymn or carol blessed. Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound. And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter change Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world, By their increase, now knows not which is which. And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension. We are their parents and original.

Do you amend it then. It lies in you. Why should Titania cross her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman.
 
Set your heart at rest. The Fairyland buys not the child of me. His mother was a votaress of my order, And in the spiced Indian air by night Full often hath she gossiped by my side, And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands, Marking th' embarked traders on the flood, When we have laughed to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait Following-her womb then rich with my young squire- Would imitate, and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. But she, being mortal, of that boy did die. And for her sake do I rear up her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him.
 
How long within this wood intend you stay?
 
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day. If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels, go with us. If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
 
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
 
Not for thy fairy kingdom.-Fairies, away! We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.

Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury.-<i>(to</i> ROBIN GOODFELLOW<i>)</i>  My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the seamaid's music?
 
I remember.
 
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west, And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts. But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon, And the imperial votaress passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free. Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell. It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound. And maidens call it "love-in-idleness." Fetch me that flower. The herb I showed thee once. The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees. Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
 
I'll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes.

Having once this juice, I'll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes. The next thing then she waking looks upon- Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey or on busy ape- She shall pursue it with the soul of love. And ere I take this charm from of her sight- As I can take it with another herb- I'll make her render up her page to me. But who comes here? I am invisible. And I will overhear their conference.
 
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not. Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? The one I'll stay, the other stayeth me. Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood. And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia. Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
 
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant. But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.
 
Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? Or rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?

And even for that do I love you the more. I am your spaniel. And, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you. Use me but as your spaniel-spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me. Only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you. What worser place can I beg in your love- And yet a place of high respect with me- Than to be used as you use your dog?
 
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit. For I am sick when I do look on thee.
 
And I am sick when I look not on you.
 
You do impeach your modesty too much, To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not, To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity.
 
Your virtue is my privilege. For that It is not night when I do see your face. Therefore I think I am not in the night. Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world. Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me?

One turf shall serve as pillow for us both. One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
 
Nay, good Lysander. For my sake, my dear, Lie further off yet. Do not lie so near.
 
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence. Love takes the meaning in love's conference. I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it. Two bosoms interchained with an oath- So then two bosoms and a single troth. Then by your side no bed room me deny. For, lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
 
Lysander riddles very prettily. Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty. Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid. So far be distant. And, good night, sweet friend. Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!

Peter Quince-
 
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
 
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
 
By 'r lakin, a parlous fear.
 
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
 
Not a whit. I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed. And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.

Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves. To bring in-God shield us!-a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living. And we ought to look to 't.
 
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
 
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck. And he himself must speak through, saying thus-or to the same defect-"Ladies," or "Fair ladies," "I would wish you" or "I would request you" or "I would entreat you" "not to fear, not to tremble, my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as other men are." And there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
 
Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber. For, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.

Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
 
A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac. Find out moonshine, find out moonshine!
 
<i>(takes out a book)</i> Yes, it doth shine that night.
 
Why then, may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open, and the moon may shine in at the casement.
 
Ay. Or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber. For Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.
 
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
 
Some man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some roughcast about him to signify wall. And let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
 
If that may be then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.-Pyramus, you begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.-And so everyone according to his cue.

"Ninus' tomb," man. Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues and all.-Pyramus, enter. Your cue is past. It is "never tire."
 
Oh. (as thisbe) As true as truest horse that yet would never tire.
 
<i>(as</i> PYRAMUS<i>)</i> If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine.
 
Oh, monstrous! Oh, strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters! Fly, masters! Help!
 
I'll follow you. I'll lead you about a round Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier. Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire. And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.

I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. Mine ear is much enamored of thy note. So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape. And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
 
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
 
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
 
Not so, neither. But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
 
Out of this wood do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no. I am a spirit of no common rate. The summer still doth tend upon my state. And I do love thee. Therefore go with me. I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee. And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep. And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.- Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!

Be kind and courteous to this gentleman. Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes. Feed him with apricoks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. The honey bags steal from the humble-bees, And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glowworms' eyes To have my love to bed and to arise. And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

I wonder if Titania be awaked. Then, what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on in extremity.
 
Here comes my messenger.-How now, mad spirit? What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
 
My mistress with a monster is in love. Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, A crew of patches, rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day. The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Pyramus presented in their sport, Forsook his scene and entered in a brake, When I did him at this advantage take, An ass's nole I fixed on his head. Anon his Thisbe must be answered, And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy, As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort, Rising and cawing at the gun's report, Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky- So at his sight away his fellows fly; And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls.

He "Murder!" cries and help from Athens calls. Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong. For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch, Some sleeves, some hats-from yielders all things catch. I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there. When in that moment so it came to pass, Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
 
This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?
 
I took him sleeping-that is finished too- And the Athenian woman by his side, That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
 
<i>(aside to</i> ROBIN<i>)</i> Stand close. This is the same Athenian.
 
<i>(aside to</i> OBERON<i>)</i> This is the woman, but not this the man.
 
Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
 
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse. For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse. If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too.

The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me. Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon May through the center creep and so displease Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes. It cannot be but thou hast murdered him. So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
 
So should the murdered look, and so should I, Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty. Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
 
What's this to my Lysander? Where is he? Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
 
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
 
Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him then? Henceforth be never numbered among men! Oh, once tell true, tell true even for my sake- Durst thou have looked upon him being awake, And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch! Could not a worm, an adder, do so much? An adder did it, for with doubler tongue Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
 
You spend your passion on a misprised mood. I am not guilty of Lysander's blood. Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

I had no judgment when to her I swore.

O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment. If you were civil and knew courtesy, You would not do me thus much injury.

None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin, and extort A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
 
You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so. For you love Hermia. This you know I know. And here, with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermia's love I yield you up my part. And yours of Helena to me bequeath, Whom I do love and will do till my death.
 
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
 
Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none. If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone. My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned, And now to Helen is it home returned, There to remain.
 
Helen, it is not so.
 
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear. Look, where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear.

All schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence? We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry-seeming parted But yet an union in partition- Two lovely berries molded on one stem;

Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury.
 
I am amazed at your passionate words. I scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.
 
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face? And made your other love, Demetrius- Who even but now did spurn me with his foot- To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent? What though I be not so in grace as you- So hung upon with love, so fortunate- But miserable most, to love unloved? This you should pity rather than despise.

Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where's Monsieur Cobweb?
 
Ready.
 
Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle. And, good monsieur, bring me the honey bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur. And good monsieur, have a care the honey bag break not. I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag, signor.

What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
 
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the tongs and the bones.
 
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
 
Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
 
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nuts.
 
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me. I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.

So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist. The female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm. Oh, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!
 
Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight? Her dotage now I do begin to pity. For, meeting her of late behind the wood, Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool, I did upbraid her and fall out with her. For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers, And that same dew, which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail. When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begged my patience, I then did ask of her her changeling child, Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in Fairyland. And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes. And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That, he awaking when the other do, May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream. But first I will release the fairy queen.

Fairy King, attend, and mark. I do hear the morning lark.
 
Then, my queen, in silence sad, Trip we after the night's shade. We the globe can compass soon Swifter than the wandering moon.
 
Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.
 
Go, one of you, find out the forester. For now our observation is performed. And since we have the vaward of the day, My love shall hear the music of my hounds. Uncouple in the western valley. Let them go. Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
 
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
 
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear Such gallant chiding. For, besides the groves,

The skies, the fountains, every region near Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
 
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew, Crook-kneed, and dew-lapped like Thessalian bulls, Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells, Each under each. A cry more tunable Was never hollaed to, nor cheered with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly. Judge when you hear.  <i>(sees the four sleeping lovers)</i>  But, soft! What nymphs are these?
 
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep. And this, Lysander. This Demetrius is. This Helena, old Nedar's Helena. I wonder of their being here together.
 
No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May, and hearing our intent Came here in grace our solemnity. But speak, Egeus. Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
 
It is, my lord.
 
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
 
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.

Pardon, my lord.
 
I pray you all, stand up.
 
<i>(to</i> LYSANDER <i>and</i> DEMETRIUS<i>)</i>  I know you two are rival enemies. How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmity?
 
My lord, I shall reply amazedly, Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here. But as I think-for truly would I speak, And now do I bethink me, so it is- I came with Hermia hither. Our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, Without the peril of the Athenian law-
 
<i>(to</i> THESEUS<i>)</i> Enough, enough, my lord. You have enough! I beg the law, the law, upon his head.- They would have stol'n away, they would, Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me, You of your wife and me of my consent, Of my consent that she should be your wife.
 
<i>(to</i> THESEUS<i>)</i> My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood. And I in fury hither followed them, Fair Helena in fancy following me.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 136 --%%--
 
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power- But by some power it is-my love to Hermia, Melted as the snow, seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon. And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena. To her, my lord, Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia. But like in sickness did I loathe this food. But as in health, come to my natural taste, Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it.
 
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met. Of this discourse we more will hear anon.- Egeus, I will overbear your will. For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit.- And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purposed hunting shall be set aside. Away with us to Athens. Three and three, We'll hold a feast in great solemnity. Come, Hippolyta.
 
These things seem small and undistinguishable, Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.

And I have found Demetrius like a jewel, Mine own, and not mine own.
 
Are you sure That we are awake? It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
 
Yea, and my father.
 
And Hippolyta.
 
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
 
Why then, we are awake. Let's follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams.
 
<i>(waking)</i> When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is "Most fair Pyramus." Heigh-ho! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-mender? Snout the tinker? Starveling? God's my life, stol'n hence, and left me asleep? I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream-past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was-there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had-but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.

It shall be called "Bottom's Dream" because it hath no bottom. And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.

Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
 
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
 
If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward. Doth it?
 
It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
 
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.
 
Yea, and the best person too. And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
 
You must say "paragon." A "paramour" is, God bless us, a thing of naught.
 
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.
 
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life. He could not have 'scaped sixpence a day. An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged.

He would have deserved it. Sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.
 
Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?
 
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
 
Masters, I am to discourse wonders-but ask me not what, for if I tell you I am no true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.
 
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
 
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man look o'er his part. For the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen. And let not him that plays the lion pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws. And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath. And I do not doubt but to hear them say, "It is a sweet comedy." No more words. Away, go away!

'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
 
More strange than true. I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends. The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact. One sees more devils than vast hell can hold- That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt. The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to heaven. And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination, That if it would but apprehend some joy, It comprehends some bringer of that joy. Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
 
But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy, But, howsoever, strange and admirable.

Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime? Where is our usual manager of mirth? What revels are in hand? Is there no play, To ease the anguish of a torturing hour? Call Philostrate.
 
Here, mighty Theseus.
 
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening? What masque, what music? How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?
 
<i>(giving</i> THESEUS <i>a document)</i>  There is a brief, how many sports are ripe. Make choice of which your highness will see first.
 
<i>(reads)</i>  "The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp." We'll none of that. That have I told my love, In glory of my kinsman Hercules. "The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage." That is an old device, and it was played When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.

"The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of learning, late deceased in beggary." That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. "A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe. Very tragical mirth." "Merry" and "tragical"? "Tedious" and "brief"? That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow. How shall we find the concord of this discord?
 
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play. But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious. For in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted. And tragical, my noble lord, it is. For Pyramus therein doth kill himself. Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water-but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed.
 
What are they that do play it?
 
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, Which never labored in their minds till now, And now have toiled their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial.
 
And we will hear it.
 
No, my noble lord. It is not for you. I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world- Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service.

I will hear that play. For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it. Go, bring them in.-And take your places, ladies.
 
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged And duty in his service perishing.
 
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
 
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
 
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing. Our sport shall be to take what they mistake. And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit. Where I have come, great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes, Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiced accent in their fears, And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet, Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome, And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence. Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most, to my capacity.

This fellow doth not stand upon points.
 
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt. He knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.

His speech was like a tangled chain. Nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
 
<i>(delivered by</i> QUINCE<i>)</i>  Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show. But wonder on, till truth make all things plain. This man is Pyramus, if you would know. This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain. This man, with lime and roughcast, doth present Wall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder. And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content To whisper. At the which let no man wonder. This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, Presenteth Moonshine. For, if you will know, By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus' tomb-there, there to woo. This grisly beast, which "Lion" hight by name, The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night, Did scare away, or rather did affright. And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall, Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain. Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, And finds his trusty Thisbe's mantle slain. Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade, He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast. And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade, His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest, Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain At large discourse, while here they do remain.

I wonder if the lion be to speak.
 
No wonder, my lord. One lion may when many asses do.
 
<i>(played by</i> SNOUT<i>)</i> In this same interlude it doth befall That I, one Snout by name, present a wall. And such a wall, as I would have you think, That had in it a crannied hole, or chink, Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, Did whisper often very secretly. This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show That I am that same wall. The truth is so. And this the cranny is, right and sinister, Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
 
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
 
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
 
Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence!

Thanks, courteous Wall. Jove shield thee well for this! But what see I? No Thisbe do I see. O wicked Wall through whom I see no bliss! Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
 
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
 
<i>(out of character)</i> No, in truth, sir, he should not. "Deceiving me" is Thisbe's cue. She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.

This lion is a very fox, for his valor.
 
True. And a goose for his discretion.
 
Not so, my lord. For his valor cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
 
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.

He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.

This is the greatest error of all the rest. The man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the "man i' th' moon"?
 
He dares not come there for the candle. For you see, it is already in snuff.

O dainty duck! O dear! Thy mantle good, What, stained with blood? Approach, ye Furies fell! O Fates, come, come, Cut thread and thrum. Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
 
This passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad.
 
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
 
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame? Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear, Which is-no, no-which was the fairest dame That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer. Come, tears, confound! Out, sword, and wound! The pap of Pyramus-

How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?
 
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.
 
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.

These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone. Lovers, make moan. His eyes were green as leeks. O Sisters three, Come, come to me With hands as pale as milk.

No epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse-for when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy. And so it is, truly, and very notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask.

I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.
 
He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I left him.
 
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
 
But few of any sort, and none of name.
 
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio.
 
Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.
 
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 4 --%%--
 
I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him-even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.
 
Did he break out into tears?
 
In great measure.
 
A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
 
I pray you, is Signor Montanto returned from the wars or no?
 
I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.
 
What is he that you ask for, niece?
 
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.
 
Oh, he's returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
 
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight, and my uncle's Fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 6 --%%--
 
Faith, niece, you tax Signor Benedick too much, but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
 
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
 
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman. He hath an excellent stomach.
 
And a good soldier too, lady.
 
And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?
 
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.
 
It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuffed man. But for the stuffing-well, we are all mortal.
 
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her. They never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them.
 
Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one, so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
 
Is 't possible?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 8 --%%--
 
Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
 
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
 
No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
 
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
 
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured.
 
I will hold friends with you, lady.
 
Do, good friend.
 
You will never run mad, niece.
 
No, not till a hot January.
 
Don Pedro is approached.
 
Good Signor Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 10 --%%--
 
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain, but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.
 
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.
 
Her mother hath many times told me so.
 
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
 
Signor Benedick, no, for then were you a child.
 
You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers herself.-Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.
 
If Signor Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
 
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signor Benedick. Nobody marks you.
 
What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 12 --%%--
 
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signor Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.
 
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted. And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
 
A dear happiness to women. They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
 
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentle- man or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face.
 
Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were.
 
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
 
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
 
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's name. I have done.
 
You always end with a jade's trick. I know you of old.
 
That is the sum of all, Leonato.-Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 14 --%%--
 
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. <i>(to</i> DON JOHN<i>)</i> Let me bid you welcome, my lord. Being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
 
I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.
 
Please it your Grace lead on?
 
Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.
 
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
 
I noted her not, but I looked on her.
 
Is she not a modest young lady?
 
Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
 
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
 
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise. Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.
 
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik'st her.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 16 --%%--
 
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?
 
Can the world buy such a jewel?
 
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?
 
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.
 
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There's her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
 
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
 
Is 't come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? Go to, i' faith, an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 18 --%%--
 
What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato's?
 
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
 
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
 
You hear, Count Claudio? I can be secret as a dumb man, I would have you think so, but on my allegiance-mark you this, on my allegiance-<i>(to</i> DON PEDRO<i>)</i> he is in love. With who? Now, that is your Grace's part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato's short daughter.
 
If this were so, so were it uttered.
 
Like the old tale, my lord: "It is not so nor 'twas not so but, indeed, God forbid it should be so."
 
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.
 
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.
 
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
 
By my troth, I speak my thought.
 
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 20 --%%--
 
And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
 
That I love her, I feel.
 
That she is worthy, I know.
 
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me. I will die in it at the stake.
 
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.
 
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.
 
That a woman conceived me, I thank her. That she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks. But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none. And the fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
 
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
 
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid.

Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.
 
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.
 
Well, as time shall try. In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.
 
The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write "Here is good horse to hire" let them signify under my sign "Here you may see Benedick the married man."
 
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
 
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
 
I look for an earthquake too, then.
 
Well, you temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's. Commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.
 
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you-
 
--%%-- pageNum: 24 --%%--
 
To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had it-
 
The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.
 
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience. And so I leave you.
 
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
 
My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
 
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
 
No child but Hero; she's his only heir. Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
 
O, my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I looked upon her with a soldier's eye, That liked but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love. But now I am returned and that war thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 26 --%%--
 
Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words. If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her and with her father, And thou shalt have her. Was 't not to this end That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
 
How sweetly you do minister to love, That know love's grief by his complexion! But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
 
What need the bridge much broader than the flood? The fairest grant is the necessity. Look what will serve is fit. 'Tis once, thou lovest, And I will fit thee with the remedy. I know we shall have reveling tonight. I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio, And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale. Then after to her father will I break, And the conclusion is, she shall be thine. In practice let us put it presently.

How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?
 
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
 
Are they good?
 
As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.
 
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
 
A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him yourself.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 30 --%%--
 
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself. But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
 
Cousins, you know what you have to do.-O, I cry you mercy, friend. Go you with me and I will use your skill.- Good cousin, have a care this busy time.

What the goodyear, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?
 
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds. Therefore the sadness is without limit.
 
You should hear reason.
 
And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
 
If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
 
I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am. I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humor.
 
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.

I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.
 
Can you make no use of your discontent?
 
I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?
 
What news, Borachio?
 
I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
 
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
 
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
 
Who? The most exquisite Claudio?
 
Even he.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 36 --%%--
 
A proper squire. And who, and who? Which way looks he?
 
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
 
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
 
Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference. I whipped me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
 
Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
 
To the death, my lord.
 
Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were o' my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
 
We'll wait upon your lordship.

Was not Count John here at supper?
 
I saw him not.
 
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.
 
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
 
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick. The one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
 
Then half Signor Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signor Benedick's face-
 
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could get her goodwill.
 
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
 
In faith, she's too curst.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 40 --%%--
 
Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God's sending that way, for it is said, "God sends a curst cow short horns," but to a cow too curst, he sends none.
 
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
 
Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face! I had rather lie in the woolen.
 
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
 
What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead his apes into hell.
 
Well then, go you into hell?
 
No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, "Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here's no place for you maids." So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter. For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.

<i>(to</i> HERO<i>)</i>Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.
 
Yes, faith, it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say, "Father, as it please you." But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say, "Father, as it please me."
 
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
 
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I'll none. Adam's sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
 
<i>(to</i> HERO<i>)</i> Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
 
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave.

No, you shall pardon me.
 
Nor will you not tell me who you are?

Not I, believe me.
 
Did he never make you laugh?

Why, he is the Prince's jester, a very dull fool, only his gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy, for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet. I would he had boarded me.
 
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
 
Do, do. He'll but break a comparison or two on me, which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy, and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night.
 
We must follow the leaders.

Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.

How know you he loves her?
 
I heard him swear his affection.
 
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
 
Come, let us to the banquet.
 
<i>(unmasking)</i>  Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. 'Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love. Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues. Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero.

Yea, the same.
 
Come, will you go with me?
 
Whither?
 
Even to the next willow, about your own business, county. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck like an usurer's chain? Or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath gat your Hero.
 
I wish him joy of her.
 
Why, that's spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?
 
I pray you, leave me.
 
Ho, now you strike like the blind man. 'Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.

Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges. But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince's fool! Ha, it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed! It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
 
Now, Signior, where's the Count? Did you see him?
 
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the goodwill of this young lady, and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
 
To be whipped? What's his fault?
 
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.
 
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 58 --%%--
 
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too, for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
 
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner.
 
If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.
 
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.
 
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block! An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her. My very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince's jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed. She would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire, too. Come, talk not of her. You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither. So indeed all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her.

Look, here she comes.
 
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on. I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?
 
None but to desire your good company.
 
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not. I cannot endure my Lady Tongue!
 
<i>(to</i> BEATRICE<i>)</i> Come, lady, come, you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.
 
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for it, a double heart for his single one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice. Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.
 
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.

So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
 
Why, how now, Count, wherefore are you sad?
 
Not sad, my lord.
 
How then, sick?
 
Neither, my lord.
 
The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.
 
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true, though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false.-Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained. Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.
 
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes. His grace hath made the match, and all grace say "Amen" to it.
 
Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.
 
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were but little happy if I could say how much.-Lady, as you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 64 --%%--
 
Speak, cousin, or if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither.
 
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
 
Yea, my lord. I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.
 
And so she doth, cousin.
 
Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry, "Heigh-ho for a husband!"
 
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
 
I would rather have one of your father's getting. Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
 
Will you have me, lady?
 
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days. Your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But I beseech your Grace pardon me. I was born to speak all mirth and no  matter.
 
Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you, for out o' question you were born in a merry hour.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 66 --%%--
 
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born.-Cousins, God give you joy!
 
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
 
I cry you mercy, uncle.-By your Grace's pardon.
 
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
 
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.
 
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
 
Oh, by no means. She mocks all her wooers out of suit.
 
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
 
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
 
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
 
Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 68 --%%--
 
Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just sevennight, and a time too brief, too, to have all things answer my mind.
 
<i>(to</i> CLAUDIO<i>)</i> Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labors, which is to bring Signor Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection, th' one with th' other. I would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.
 
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.
 
And I, my lord.
 
And you too, gentle Hero?
 
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.
 
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humor your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick.-And I, with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 70 --%%--
 
It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.
 
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
 
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me. I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
 
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.
 
Show me briefly how.
 
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
 
I remember.
 
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
 
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?
 
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince your brother. Spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned Claudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold up, to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 72 --%%--
 
What proof shall I make of that?
 
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?
 
Only to despite them, I will endeavor anything.
 
Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone. Tell them that you know that Hero loves me. Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother's honor, who hath made this match, and his friend's reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret "Hero," hear Margaret term me "Claudio," and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent, and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
 
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
 
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.
 
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

Boy!
 
Signior?
 
In my chamber window lies a book. Bring it hither to me in the orchard.
 
I am here already, sir.
 
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.
 
I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love- and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe. I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not.

I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; fair, or I'll ever look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God. Ha! The Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbor.
 
Come, shall we hear this music?
 
Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is, As hushed on purpose to grace harmony!
 
<i>(aside to</i> CLAUDIO<i>)</i>  See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection. I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
 
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing, Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy, yet he woos, Yet will he swear he loves.
 
Nay, pray thee, come, Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument, Do it in notes.
 
Note this before my notes: There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
 
Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks! Note notes, forsooth, and nothing.

The best I can, my lord.
 
Do so. Farewell.
 
Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick?
 
Oh, ay. <i>(aside to</i> DON PEDRO<i>)</i> Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits.-I did never think that lady would have loved any man.
 
No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signor Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
 
<i>(aside)</i> Is 't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
 
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged affection, it is past the infinite of thought.
 
May be she doth but counterfeit.
 
Faith, like enough.
 
O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.
 
Why, what effects of passion shows she?
 
<i>(aside to</i> LEONATO<i>)</i> Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 84 --%%--
 
What effects, my lord? She will sit you-you heard my daughter tell you how.
 
She did indeed.
 
How, how I pray you? You amaze me. I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.
 
I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against Benedick.
 
<i>(aside)</i> I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it. Knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such reverence.
 
<i>(aside to</i> DON PEDRO<i>)</i> He hath ta'en th' infection. Hold it up.
 
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
 
No, and swears she never will. That's her torment.
 
'Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. "Shall I," says she, "that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him?"
 
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him, for she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us all.
 
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 86 --%%--
 
Oh, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found "Benedick" and "Beatrice" between the sheet?
 
That.
 
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her. "I measure him," says she, "by my own spirit, for I should flout him if he writ to me, yea, though I love him, I should."
 
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: "O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!"
 
She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.
 
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.
 
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.
 
An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.
 
And she is exceeding wise.
 
In every thing but in loving Benedick.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 88 --%%--
 
Oh, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
 
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say.
 
Were it good, think you?
 
Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.
 
She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
 
He is a very proper man.
 
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
 
Before God, and in my mind, very wise.
 
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
 
And I take him to be valiant.
 
As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 90 --%%--
 
If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep peace. If he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
 
And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
 
Never tell him, my lord, let her wear it out with good counsel.
 
Nay, that's impossible. She may wear her heart out first.
 
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
 
My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.
 
<i>(aside to</i> DON PEDRO <i>and</i> LEONATO<i>)</i> If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation.
 
<i>(aside to</i> LEONATO<i>)</i> Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter. That's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

<i>(coming forward)</i> This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited! I hear how I am censured. They sy I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say, too, that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a truth, I can bear them witness. And virtuous; 'tis so, I cannot reprove it. And wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her! I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage, but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No! The world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she's a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.
 
Against my will, I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
 
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.

I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful, I would not have come.
 
You take pleasure then in the message?
 
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, Signior. Fare you well.
 
Ha! "Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that. "I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me." That's as much as to say, "Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks." If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain. If I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor. There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio. Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us, And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her To listen our propose. This is thy office. Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
 
I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
 
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick. When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit. My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made, That only wounds by hearsay.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 98 --%%--
 
Now begin, For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
 
<i>(aside to</i> HERO<i>)</i>  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait. So angle we for Beatrice, who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture. Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
 
<i>(aside to</i> URSULA<i>)</i>  Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.-  <i>(approaching the bower)</i>  No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful. I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock.
 
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
 
So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord.
 
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
 
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it, But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it.
 
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 100 --%%--
 
O god of love! I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man, But Nature never framed a woman's heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice. Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprizing what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak. She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self-endeared.
 
Sure, I think so, And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
 
Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured But she would spell him backward. If fair-faced, She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic, Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; If low, an agate very vilely cut; If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; If silent, why, a block moved with none. So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
 
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
 
No, not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable. But who dare tell her so? If I should speak, She would mock me into air. O, she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 102 --%%--
 
Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly. It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling.
 
Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
 
No, rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion; And truly I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with. One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking.
 
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong! She cannot be so much without true judgment, Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have, as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
 
He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.
 
I pray you, be not angry with me, madam, Speaking my fancy. Signor Benedick, For shape, for bearing, argument and valor, Goes foremost in report through Italy.
 
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
 
His excellence did earn it, ere he had it. When are you married, madam?

Why, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in. I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.
 
<i>(aside to</i> HERO<i>)</i>  She's limed, I warrant you. We have caught her, madam.
 
<i>(aside to</i> URSULA<i>)</i>  If it proves so, then loving goes by haps; Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
 
<i>(coming forward)</i>  What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much? Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adieu! No glory lives behind the back of such. And Benedick, love on; I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand. If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band. For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly.

Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
 
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
 
So say I. Methinks you are sadder.

Hang him, truant! There's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.

There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
 
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs. He brushes his hat o' mornings. What should that bode?
 
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
 
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.
 
Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.

I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.
 
Who, Hero?
 
Even she: Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero.
 
Disloyal?
 
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness. I could say she were worse. Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant. Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day. If you love her then, tomorrow wed her. But it would better fit your honor to change your mind.
 
<i>(to</i> DON PEDRO<i>)</i> May this be so?
 
I will not think it.

If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I will show you enough, and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly.
 
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.
 
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.
 
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses. Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself.

Are you good men and true?
 
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.
 
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince's watch.
 
Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.
 
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
 
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can write and read.
 
Come hither, neighbor Seacole. God hath blessed you with a good name. To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.
 
Both which, Master Constable-
 
You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge:
 
--%%-- pageNum: 120 --%%--
 
you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince's name.
 
How if he will not stand?
 
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.
 
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince's subjects.
 
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince's subjects.-You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
 
We will rather sleep than talk. We know what belongs to a watch.
 
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend. Only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
 
How if they will not?
 
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.
 
Well, sir.

If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man, and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why the more is for your honesty.
 
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
 
Truly, by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
 
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
 
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.
 
<i>(to the Watch)</i> If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.
 
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
 
Why then, depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a calf when he bleats.
 
'Tis very true.
 
This is the end of the charge. You, constable, are to present the Prince's own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.
 
Nay, by 'r Lady, that I think he cannot.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 124 --%%--
 
Five shillings to one on 't, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him-marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.
 
By 'r lady, I think it be so.
 
Ha, ha, ha!-Well, masters, good night. An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.-Come, neighbor.
 
Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.
 
One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight. Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.

<i>(aside)</i> Some treason, masters. Yet stand close.
 
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
 
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?
 
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich. For when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.
 
I wonder at it.
 
That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.
 
Yes, it is apparel.
 
I mean the fashion.
 
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

Tush, I may as well say the fool's the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?
 
<i>(aside)</i> I know that Deformed. He has been a vile thief this seven year. He goes up and down like a gentleman. I remember his name.
 
Didst thou not hear somebody?
 
No, 'twas the vane on the house.
 
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is, how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty, sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers in the reechy painting, sometime like god Bel's priests in the old church-window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
 
All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
 
Not so, neither. But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the name of Hero. She leans me out at her mistress' chamber window, bids me a thousand times good night. I tell this tale vilely. I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 130 --%%--
 
And thought they Margaret was Hero?
 
Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged, swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o'ernight and send her home again without a husband.
 
We charge you, in the Prince's name, stand!
 
Call up the right Master Constable. We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.
 
And one Deformed is one of them. I know him; he wears a lock.

God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.
 
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
 
Fie upon thee! Art not ashamed?
 
Of what, lady? Of speaking honorably? Is not marriage honorable in a beggar? Is not your lord honorable without marriage? I think you would have me say, "Saving your reverence, a husband." An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend nobody. Is there any harm in "the heavier for a husband"? None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife.

Moral! No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning. I meant plain holy thistle. You may think perchance that I think you are in love. Nay, by 'r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man. He swore he would never marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging.

Stand thee by, Friar.-Father, by your leave, Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid, your daughter?
 
As freely, son, as God did give her me.
 
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
 
Nothing, unless you render her again.
 
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.- There, Leonato, take her back again. Give not this rotten orange to your friend. She's but the sign and semblance of her honor. Behold how like a maid she blushes here! Oh, what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal! Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid By these exterior shows? But she is none. She knows the heat of a luxurious bed. Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

What do you mean, my lord?
 
Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
 
Dear my lord, if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity-
 
I know what you would say: if I have known her, You will say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the forehand sin. No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large But, as a brother to his sister, showed Bashful sincerity and comely love.
 
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?
 
Out on thee, seeming! I will write against it. You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown. But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pampered animals That rage in savage sensuality.
 
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

Let me but move one question to your daughter, And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
 
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
 
Oh, God defend me! how am I beset!- What kind of catechizing call you this?
 
To make you answer truly to your name.
 
Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name With any just reproach?
 
Marry, that can Hero! Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue. What man was he talked with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one? Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

Fie, fie, they are not to be named, my lord, Not to be spoke of! There is not chastity enough in language, Without offense, to utter them.-Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
 
O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been If half thy outward graces had been placed About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart! But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! Farewell, Thou pure impiety and impious purity. For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love, And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang, To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm, And never shall it more be gracious.

Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood?- Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes, For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, Strike at thy life. Grieved I I had but one? Chid I for that at frugal Nature's frame? O, one too much by thee! Why had I one? Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes? Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates, Who, smirched thus, and mired with infamy, I might have said, "No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins"?

Hear me a little, For I have only silent been so long, And given way unto this course of fortune, By noting of the lady. I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes, And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,

Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
 
They know that do accuse me. I know none. If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy!-O my father, Prove you that any man with me conversed At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintained the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case. Your daughter here the princes left for dead. Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed. Maintain a mourning ostentation, And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial.
 
What shall become of this? What will this do?
 
Marry, this, well carried, shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse. That is some good. But not for that dream I on this strange course, But on this travail look for greater birth. She, dying, as it must so be maintained, Upon the instant that she was accused, Shall be lamented, pitied and excused Of every hearer. For it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lacked and lost, Why then we rack the value, then we find

The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio. When he shall hear she died upon his words, The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination, And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparelled in more precious habit, More moving, delicate and full of life, Into the eye and prospect of his soul Than when she lived indeed. Then shall he mourn, If ever love had interest in his liver, And wish he had not so accused her, No, though he thought his accusation true. Let this be so, and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood. But if all aim but this be leveled false, The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy. And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation, In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.
 
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you. And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.

Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
 
Nay, but Beatrice-
 
Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
 
Beat-

Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant, surely! Oh, that I were a man for his sake! Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too. He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
 
Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
 
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
 
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
 
Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
 
Enough, I am engaged. I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go comfort your cousin. I must say she is dead, and so, farewell.

Is our whole dissembly appeared?
 
Oh, a stool and a cushion for the Sexton.
 
Which be the malefactors?
 
Marry, that am I and my partner.
 
Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
 
But which are the offenders that are to be examined? Let them come before Master Constable.
 
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?
 
What's your name, friend?
 
Borachio.
 
Pray, write down, "Borachio."-Yours, sirrah?
 
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 180 --%%--
 
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade."-Masters, do you serve God?
 
Yea, sir, we hope.
 
Write down that they hope they serve God; and write God first, for God defend but God should go before such villains!-Masters, it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?
 
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
 
A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you, but I will go about with him.-Come you hither, sirrah, a word in your ear. Sir, I say to you it is thought you are false knaves.
 
Sir, I say to you we are none.
 
Well, stand aside.-'Fore God, they are both in a ale. Have you writ down that they are none?
 
Master Constable, you go not the way to examine. You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
 
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way.-Let the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you in the Prince's name, accuse these men.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 182 --%%--
 
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince's brother, was a villain.
 
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
 
Master Constable-
 
Pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
 
<i>(to Watch)</i> What heard you him say else?
 
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
 
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
 
Yea, by Mass, that it is.
 
What else, fellow?
 
And that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her.
 
<i>(to</i> BORACHIO<i>)</i> O villain! Thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this.
 
What else?
 
This is all.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 184 --%%--
 
And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away. Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner refused, and upon the grief of this, suddenly died.-Master Constable, let these men be bound and brought to Leonato's. I will go before and show him their examination.
 
Come, let them be opinioned.
 
Let them be in the hands-
 
Off, coxcomb!
 
God's my life, where's the Sexton? Let him write down the Prince's officer "coxcomb." Come, bind them.-Thou naughty varlet!
 
Away! You are an ass, you are an ass!
 
Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years? Oh, that he were here to write me down an ass! But masters, remember that I am an ass, though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.-No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness. I am a wise fellow and, which is more, an officer and, which is more, a householder and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to, and a rich fellow enough, go to, and a fellow that hath had losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him.-Bring him away.-Oh, that I had been writ down an ass!

If you go on thus, you will kill yourself, And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.
 
I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel, Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine. Bring me a father that so loved his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine, And bid him speak of patience. Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine, And let it answer every strain for strain, As thus for thus and such a grief for such, In every lineament, branch, shape, and form. If such a one will smile and stroke his beard, Bid sorrow wag, cry "hem" when he should groan, Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me And I of him will gather patience. But there is no such man. For, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel, but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion which before Would give preceptial med'cine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread, Charm ache with air, and agony with words.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 188 --%%--
 
No, no, 'tis all men's office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no man's virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel. My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
 
Therein do men from children nothing differ.
 
I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood, For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.
 
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself. Make those that do offend you suffer too.
 
There thou speak'st reason. Nay, I will do so. My soul doth tell me Hero is belied, And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her.
 
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
 
Good e'en, good e'en.
 
Good day to both of you.
 
Hear you, my lords-
 
We have some haste, Leonato.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 190 --%%--
 
Some haste, my lord! Well, fare you well, my lord. Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.
 
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
 
If he could right himself with quarreling, Some of us would lie low.
 
Who wrongs him?
 
Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou. Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword. I fear thee not.
 
Marry, beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear. In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
 
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me. I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young, or what would do Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by, And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man. I say thou hast belied mine innocent child. Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors, Oh, in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers, framed by thy villainy.
 
My villainy?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 192 --%%--
 
Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.
 
You say not right, old man.
 
My lord, my lord, I'll prove it on his body if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practice, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
 
Away! I will not have to do with you.
 
Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast killed my child. If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
 
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed, But that's no matter. Let him kill one first. Win me and wear me! Let him answer me.- Come, follow me, boy. Come, sir boy, come, follow me. Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence, Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
 
Brother-
 
Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece, And she is dead, slandered to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.- Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
 
Brother Anthony-

Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea, And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple- Scrambling, outfacing, fashion-monging boys, That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, Go anticly and show outward hideousness, And speak off half a dozen dang'rous words How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst, And this is all.
 
But brother Anthony-
 
Come, 'tis no matter. Do not you meddle. Let me deal in this.
 
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience. My heart is sorry for your daughter's death, But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.
 
My lord, my lord-
 
I will not hear you.
 
No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.
 
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
 
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.
 
Now, Signior, what news?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 196 --%%--
 
<i>(to</i> DON PEDRO<i>)</i> Good day, my lord.
 
Welcome, Signior. You are almost come to part almost a fray.
 
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.
 
Leonato and his brother. What think'st thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
 
In a false quarrel there is no true valor. I came to seek you both.
 
We have been up and down to seek thee, for we are high- proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
 
It is in my scabbard. Shall I draw it?
 
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
 
Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels: draw to pleasure us.
 
As I am an honest man, he looks pale.-Art thou sick, or angry?
 
<i>(to</i> BENEDICK<i>)</i> What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat? Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 198 --%%--
 
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an you charge it against me. I pray you, choose another subject.
 
<i>(to</i> DON PEDRO<i>)</i> Nay, then, give him another staff. This last was broke 'cross.
 
By this light, he changes more and more. I think he be angry indeed.
 
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
 
Shall I speak a word in your ear?
 
God bless me from a challenge!
 
<i>(aside to</i> CLAUDIO<i>)</i> You are a villain. I jest not. I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.
 
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
 
What, a feast, a feast?
 
I' faith, I thank him. He hath bid me to a calf's head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?
 
Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.

I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit. "True," said she, "a fine little one." "No," said I, "a great wit." "Right," says she, "a great gross one." "Nay," said I, "a good wit." "Just," said she, "it hurts nobody." "Nay," said I, "the gentleman is wise." "Certain," said she, "a wise gentleman." "Nay," said I, "he hath the tongues." "That I believe," said she, "for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning; there's a double tongue, there's two tongues." Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper'st man in Italy.
 
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.
 
Yea, that she did. But yet for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's daughter told us all.
 
All, all. And, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.
 
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head?
 
Yea, and text underneath: "Here dwells Benedick the married man"?
 
Fare you well, boy. You know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not.-My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 202 --%%--
 
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.
 
He is in earnest.
 
In most profound earnest, and, I'll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.
 
And hath challenged thee?
 
Most sincerely.
 
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
 
He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man.
 
But soft you, let me be. Pluck up, my heart, and be sad. Did he not say my brother was fled?
 
Come you, sir. If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
 
How now? Two of my brother's men bound! Borachio one!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 204 --%%--
 
Hearken after their offense, my lord.
 
Officers, what offense have these men done?
 
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
 
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what's their offense; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge.
 
Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
 
<i>(to</i> BORACHIO <i>and</i> CONRADE<i>)</i> Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What's your offense?
 
Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments, how you disgraced her when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation. And, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 206 --%%--
 
<i>(to</i> CLAUDIO<i>)</i> Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
 
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.
 
<i>(to</i> BORACHIO<i>)</i> But did my brother set thee on to this?
 
Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.
 
He is composed and framed of treachery, And fled he is upon this villainy.
 
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
 
Come, bring away the plaintiffs. By this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And, masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
 
Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the Sexton too.
 
Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him. Which of these is he?
 
If you would know your wronger, look on me.
 
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 208 --%%--
 
Yea, even I alone.
 
No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself. Here stand a pair of honorable men- A third is fled-that had a hand in it.- I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death. Record it with your high and worthy deeds. 'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
 
I know not how to pray your patience, Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself. Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin. Yet sinned I not But in mistaking.
 
By my soul, nor I, And yet to satisfy this good old man I would bend under any heavy weight That he'll enjoin me to.
 
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live- That were impossible-but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died. And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones. Sing it tonight. Tomorrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that's dead, And she alone is heir to both of us. Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 210 --%%--
 
O noble sir! Your overkindness doth wring tears from me. I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio.
 
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming. Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who I believe was packed in all this wrong, Hired to it by your brother.
 
No, by my soul, she was not, Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me, But always hath been just and virtuous In any thing that I do know by her.
 
<i>(to</i> LEONATO<i>)</i> Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass. I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment. And also the watch heard them talk of one Deformed. They say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in God's name, the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing for God's sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.
 
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
 
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.

God save the foundation!
 
Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
 
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship, which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your Worship! I wish your Worship well. God restore you to health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it!- Come, neighbor.
 
Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.
 
Farewell, my lords. We look for you tomorrow.
 
We will not fail.
 
Tonight I'll mourn with Hero.
 
<i>(to the Watch)</i>  Bring you these fellows on.-We'll talk with Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.

Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
 
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
 
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it, for in most comely truth thou deservest it.
 
To have no man come over me! Why, shall I always keep below stairs?
 
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
 
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit but hurt not.
 
A most manly wit, Margaret, it will not hurt a woman. And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.
 
Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
 
If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
 
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 216 --%%--
 
And therefore will come.
 
<i>(sings)</i>  <i>The god of love</i>, <i>That sits above</i>, <i>And knows me, and knows me</i>, <i>How pitiful I deserve</i>- I mean in singing. But in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to "lady" but "baby"-an innocent rhyme; for "scorn," "horn"-a hard rhyme; for, "school," "fool"-a babbling rhyme; very ominous endings. No, I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
 
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
 
Yea, Signior, and depart when you bid me.
 
Oh , stay but till then!
 
"Then" is spoken. Fare you well now. And yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came, which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
 
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 218 --%%--
 
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome. Therefore I will depart unkissed.
 
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
 
For them all together, which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?
 
Suffer love! A good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.
 
In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart, if you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I will never love that which my riend hates.
 
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
 
It appears not in this confession. There's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
 
An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the lime of good neighbors. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.
 
And how long is that, think you?

Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum. Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. An now tell me, how doth your cousin?
 
Very ill.
 
And how do you?
 
Very ill, too.
 
Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste.
 
Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home. It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?
 
Will you go hear this news, Signior?

<i>(reading an epitaph)</i>  Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies. Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies. So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame.
 
Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb. Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.  <i>(Song)</i>  <i>Pardon, goddess of the night</i>, <i>Those that slew thy virgin knight</i>, <i>For the which with songs of woe</i>  <i>Round about her tomb they go</i>. <i>Midnight, assist our moan</i>. <i>Help us to sigh and groan</i>  <i>Heavily, heavily</i>. <i>Graves, yawn and yield your dead</i>, <i>Till death be uttered</i>, <i>Heavily, heavily</i>.

Did I not tell you she was innocent?
 
So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated. But Margaret was in some fault for this, Although against her will, as it appears In the true course of all the question.
 
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
 
And so am I, being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
 
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither masked. The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me.-You know your office, brother. You must be father to your brother's daughter, And give her to young Claudio.
 
Which I will do with confirmed countenance.
 
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

To bind me or undo me, one of them.- Signior Leonato, truth it is, good Signior, Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.
 
That eye my daughter lent her; 'tis most true.
 
And I do with an eye of love requite her.
 
The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the Prince. But what's your will?
 
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical. But for my will, my will is your goodwill May stand with ours, this day to be conjoined In the state of honorable marriage- In which, good Friar, I shall desire your help.
 
My heart is with your liking.
 
And my help. Here comes the Prince and Claudio.

<i>(unmasking)</i> I answer to that name. What is your will?
 
Do not you love me?
 
Why no, no more than reason.
 
Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived. They swore you did.
 
Do not you love me?

Troth, no, no more than reason.
 
Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.
 
They swore that you were almost sick for me.
 
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
 
'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
 
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
 
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
 
And I'll be sworn upon 't that he loves her, For here's a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashioned to Beatrice.  <i>(Shows a paper)</i>
 
And here's another, Writ in my cousin's hand, stol'n from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.  <i>(Shows a paper)</i>
 
A miracle! Here's our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
 
I would not deny you, but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.
 
Peace! I will stop your mouth.

How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
 
I'll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No. If a man will be beaten with brains, he shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it. For man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion.-For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.
 
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgeled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee.
 
Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels.
 
We'll have dancing afterward.
 
First, of my word! Therefore play, music.-Prince, thou art sad. Get thee a wife, get thee a wife. There is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.

Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service. Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to th' first. Now sir, be judge yourself, Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor.
 
I would not follow him then.
 
O sir, content you. I follow him to serve my turn upon him. We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That (doting on his own obsequious bondage) Wears out his time much like his master's ass For naught but provender, and when he's old, cashiered. Whip me such honest knaves.

For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In compliment extern, 'tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at.

Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you-
 
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse. You'll have your nephews neigh to you. You'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

It is too true an evil. Gone she is. And what's to come of my despised time Is naught but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her?-Oh, unhappy girl!- With the Moor, say'st thou?-Who would be a father?- How didst thou know 'twas she?-Oh, she deceives me Past thought!-What said she to you?-Get more tapers, Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
 
Truly, I think they are.
 
Oh, heaven, how got she out? Oh, treason of the blood! Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act. Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?
 
Yes, sir, I have indeed.

Something from Cyprus as I may divine. It is a business of some heat.

O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter? Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her! For I'll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy, So opposite to marriage that she shunned The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, Would ever have, t' incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou-to fear, not to delight. Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion. I'll have 't disputed on. 'Tis probable and palpable to thinking. I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world, a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.- Lay hold upon him. If he do resist, Subdue him at his peril!

How say you by this change?
 
This cannot be, By no assay of reason. 'Tis a pageant, To keep us in false gaze. When we consider Th' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it, For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks th' abilities That Rhodes is dressed in. If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskillful To leave that latest which concerns him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless.
 
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
 
Here is more news.
 
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approved good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, It is most true. True, I have married her. The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace, For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field, And little of this great world can I speak,

More than pertains to feats of broils and battle, And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round unvarnished tale deliver Of my whole course of love. What drugs, what charms, What conjuration and what mighty magic- For such proceeding I am charged withal- I won his daughter.
 
A maiden never bold, Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature, Of years, of country, credit, everything, To fall in love with what she feared to look on? It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err. Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be. I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram, conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her.
 
To vouch this is no proof, Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
 
But, Othello, speak. Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid's affections? Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?
 
I do beseech you, Send for the lady to the Sagittary,

Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.
 
And till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love And she in mine.
 
Say it, Othello.
 
Her father loved me, oft invited me, Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed. I ran it through, even from my boyish days, To th' very moment that he bade me tell it, Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents by flood and field, Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' th' imminent deadly breach, Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence And portance in my traveler's history. Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks, hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speak-such was my process- And of the Cannibals that each others eat,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 40 --%%--
 
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline. But still the house affairs would draw her hence, Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, She'd come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse, which I, observing, Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively. I did consent, And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffered. My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs. She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange, 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful. She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked me And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake. She loved me for the dangers I had passed, And I loved her that she did pity them. This only is the witchcraft I have used. Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.
 
I think this tale would win my daughter too. Good Brabantio. Take up this mangled matter at the best. Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands.

I pray you, hear her speak. If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man.-Come hither, gentle mistress. Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience?
 
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty. To you I am bound for life and education. My life and education both do learn me How to respect you. You are the lord of duty. I am hitherto your daughter. But here's my husband. And so much duty as my mother showed To you, preferring you before her father, So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord.
 
God be with you. I have done. Please it your grace, on to the state affairs. I had rather to adopt a child than get it.- Come hither, Moor. I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child. For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.-I have done, my lord.

To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on. What cannot be preserved when fortune takes, Patience her injury a mock'ry makes. The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief, He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
 
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile, We lose it not, so long as we can smile. He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears. But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. These sentences to sugar or to gall, Being strong on both sides, are equivocal. But words are words. I never yet did hear That the bruised heart was pierced through the ears. I humbly beseech you, proceed to th' affairs of state.
 
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you, and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you.

I saw Othello's visage in his mind, And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. So that, dear lords, if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war, The rites for which I love him are bereft me, And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence.

Virtue? A fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many-either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry-why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts. Whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.
 
It cannot be.
 
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies! I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness.

I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse. Follow thou the wars, defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor-put money in thy purse-nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration-put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills-fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her. Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! 'Tis clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.
 
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
 
Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted. Thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.

Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your purse.

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse. For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He's done my office. I know not if 't be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety. He holds me well.

Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood. I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail.

A segregation of the Turkish fleet. For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds, The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, Seems to cast water on the burning bear, And quench the guards of th' ever-fixed pole.

I am glad on 't. 'Tis a worthy governor.
 
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe. For they were parted With foul and violent tempest.
 
Pray heavens he be, For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho! As well to see the vessel that's come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, Even till we make the main and th' aerial blue An indistinct regard.

How now? Who has put in?
 
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
 
He's had most favorable and happy speed. Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, The guttered rocks and congregated sands, Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel, As having sense of beauty, do omit Their mortal natures, letting go safely by The divine Desdemona.
 
What is she?
 
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard, And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort!

He is not yet arrived. Nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here.

I am about it, but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze, It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors And thus she is delivered: If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, The one's for use, the other useth it.
 
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
 
If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
 
Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?

Oh my fair warrior!
 
My dear Othello!
 
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me. Oh, my soul's joy! If after every tempest come such calms, May the winds blow till they have wakened death, And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus-high, and duck again as low As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.

<i>(aside)</i>  Oh, you are well tuned now, But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, As honest as I am.
 
Come, let us to the castle. News, friends! Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned. How does my old acquaintance of this isle?- Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus, I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote In mine own comforts.-I prithee, good Iago, Go to the bay and disembark my coffers. Bring thou the master to the citadel. He is a good one, and his worthiness Does challenge much respect.-Come, Desdemona, Once more, well met at Cyprus.
 
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.-Come hither. If thou be'st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them, list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 80 --%%--
 
With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
 
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners and beauties. All which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted-as it is a most pregnant and unforced position-who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions that has an eye, can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself. A devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.
 
I cannot believe that in her. She's full of most blessed condition.
 
Blessed fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?

Lechery, by this hand, an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutabilities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th' incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight for the command, I'll lay 't upon you. Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.
 
Well.
 
Sir, he's rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may. For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
 
I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.
 
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe 't. That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit. The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too, Not out of absolute lust-though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin- But partly led to diet my revenge, For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leaped into my seat. The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife. Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, Abuse him to the Moor in the right garb (For I fear Cassio with my night-cape too) Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused. Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.

This it is, general: Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause, Myself the crying fellow did pursue, Lest by his clamor-as it so fell out- The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot, Outran my purpose, and I returned then rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight I ne'er might say before.

I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee But never more be officer of mine.-
 
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up! I'll make thee an example.
 
What's the matter, dear?
 
All's well, sweeting, Come away to bed.-<i>(to</i> MONTANO<i>)</i> Sir, for your hurts Myself will be your surgeon. Lead him off.
 
Iago, look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.- Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
 
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
 
Ay, past all surgery.
 
Marry, heaven forbid!

Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
 
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound. There is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again and he's yours.
 
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!
 
What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?
 
I know not.
 
Is 't possible?
 
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly. A quarrel, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 112 --%%--
 
Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus recovered?
 
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
 
Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen. But since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
 
I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard. Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! Oh, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
 
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
 
I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
 
You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general. I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 114 --%%--
 
You advise me well.
 
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
 
I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me.
 
You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.
 
Good night, honest Iago.
 
And what's he then that says I play the villain? When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful As the free elements. And then for her To win the Moor, were to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, His soul is so enfettered to her love, That she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now. For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, I'll pour this pestilence into his ear:
 
--%%-- pageNum: 116 --%%--
 
That she repeals him for her body's lust. And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor. So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.
 
How now, Roderigo!
 
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains. And so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
 
How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time. Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee. And thou, by that small hurt, hath cashiered Cassio. Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe. Content thyself awhile. In troth, 'tis morning. Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Retire thee, go where thou art billeted. Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter. Nay, get thee gone.

Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress. I'll set her on. Myself, the while, to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way. Dull not device by coldness and delay.

Masters, play here, I will content your pains. Something that's brief, and bid "Good morrow, general."
 
Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' th' nose thus?
 
How, sir? How?
 
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
 
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
 
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.
 
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
 
Marry sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you, and the general so likes your music that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it.
 
Well, sir, we will not.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 122 --%%--
 
If you have any music that may not be heard, to 't again. But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
 
We have none such, sir.
 
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away. Go, vanish into air, away!
 
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
 
No, I hear not your honest friend, I hear you.
 
Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech. Wilt thou do this?
 
She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.
 
In happy time, Iago.
 
You have not been abed, then?
 
Why, no. The day had broke Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, To send in to your wife. My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.

I'll send her to you presently, And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way, that your converse and business May be more free.
 
I humbly thank you for't.
 
I never knew a Florentine more kind and honest.
 
Good morrow, good Lieutenant. I am sorry For your displeasure, but all will sure be well. The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again.
 
Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone.
 
Pray you come in. I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.
 
I am much bound to you.

We'll wait upon your lordship.

Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.
 
Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his.
 
Oh, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
 
Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He's never anything but your true servant.
 
I know 't, I thank you. You do love my lord. You have known him long, and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a polite distance.
 
Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstances, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.
 
Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee, If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it To the last article. My lord shall never rest, I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.

Madam, here comes my lord.
 
Madam, I'll take my leave.
 
Why, stay and hear me speak.
 
Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.
 
Well, do your discretion.
 
Ha! I like not that.
 
What dost thou say?
 
Nothing, my lord, or if-I know not what.
 
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
 
Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it That he would steal away so guilty-like Seeing you coming.
 
I do believe 'twas he.

How now, my lord? I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure.
 
Who is 't you mean?
 
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take. For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment in an honest face. I prithee, call him back.
 
Went he hence now?
 
Ay, sooth, so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
 
Not now, sweet Desdemona. Some other time.
 
But shall 't be shortly?
 
The sooner, sweet, for you.
 
Shall 't be tonight at supper?
 
No, not tonight.
 
Tomorrow dinner, then?
 
I shall not dine at home, I meet the captains at the citadel.

Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn. On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn. I prithee name the time, but let it not Exceed three days. In faith, he's penitent, And yet his trespass, in our common reason (Save that, they say, the wars must make example Out of her best) is not, almost, a fault T' incur a private check. When shall he come? Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mamm'ring on. What? Michael Cassio That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, Hath ta'en your part, to have so much to do To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much-
 
Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will, I will deny thee nothing.
 
Why, this is not a boon, 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted.
 
I will deny thee nothing! Whereon I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leave me but a little to myself.
 
Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
 
Farewell, my Desdemona. I'll come to thee straight.

Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee! And when I love thee not Chaos is come again.
 
My noble lord-
 
What dost thou say, Iago?
 
Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, Know of your love?
 
He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
 
But for a satisfaction of my thought, No further harm.
 
Why of thy thought, Iago?
 
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
 
Oh, yes, and went between us very oft.
 
Indeed?
 
Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern'st thou aught in that? Is he not honest?
 
Honest, my lord?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 138 --%%--
 
Honest, ay, honest.
 
My lord, for aught I know.
 
What dost thou think?
 
Think, my lord?
 
"Think, my lord?" Alas, thou echo'st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. I heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like? And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing, thou cried'st "Indeed?" And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me Show me thy thought.
 
My lord, you know I love you.
 
I think thou dost. And for I know thou 'rt full of love and honesty And weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more. For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just They are close dilations, working from the heart, That passion cannot rule.
 
For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest.
 
I think so too.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 140 --%%--
 
Men should be what they seem, Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
 
Certain, men should be what they seem.
 
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
 
Nay, yet there's more in this. I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.
 
Good my lord, pardon me, Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false, As where's that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure Wherein uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law-days and in sessions sit With meditations lawful?
 
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.
 
I do beseech you, Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, As, I confess, it is my nature's plague To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not, that your wisdom, From one that so imperfectly conceits, Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance. It were not for your quiet nor your good,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 142 --%%--
 
Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom To let you know my thoughts.
 
What dost thou mean?
 
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls. Who steals my purse steals trash. 'Tis something, nothing: 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed.
 
I'll know thy thoughts.
 
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
 
Ha!
 
Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy! It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger, But, oh, what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts- suspects, yet soundly loves!
 
Oh, misery!
 
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough, But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor. Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 144 --%%--
 
Why, why is this? Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt Is to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blowed surmises, Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances. Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt, For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago, I'll see before I doubt, when I doubt, prove, And on the proof there is no more but this: Away at once with love or jealousy!
 
I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio. Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure. I would not have your free and noble nature Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to 't. I know our country disposition well. In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience Is not to leave 't undone, but keep't unknown.

Ay, there's the point. As, to be bold with you, Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, Whereto we see in all things nature tends- Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank, Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural. But-pardon me-I do not in position Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fall to match you with her country forms, And happily repent.
 
Farewell, farewell. If more thou dost perceive, let me know more. Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.

Fear not my government.
 
I once more take my leave.
 
This fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities, with a learned spirit, Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have, or for I am declined Into the vale of years-yet that's not much- She's gone, I am abused, and my relief Must be to loathe her. Oh, curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses. Yet 'tis the plague to great ones, Prerogatived are they less than the base. 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death. Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken. Look where she comes.

I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin And let him find it. Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ. This may do something. The Moor already changes with my poison. Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulfur.

I am sorry to hear this.

And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dead clamors counterfeit, Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone.

My noble lord-
 
If thou dost slander her and torture me, Never pray more. Abandon all remorse. On horror's head horrors accumulate, Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed, For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that.
 
Oh, grace! Oh, heaven forgive me! Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense? God buy you, take mine office. O wretched fool That lov'st to make thine honesty a vice! O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe. I thank you for this profit, and from hence I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
 
Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.
 
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool And loses that it works for.
 
By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not. I think that thou art just and think thou art not. I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face. If there be cords or knives, Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion. I do repent me that I put it to you. You would be satisfied?
 
Would? Nay, and I will.
 
And may, but how? How satisfied, my lord? Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped?
 
Death and damnation! Oh!
 
It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then, If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own! What then? How then? What shall I say? Where's satisfaction? It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say, If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction, you may have 't.
 
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
 
I do not like the office. But, sith I am entered in this cause so far, Pricked to 't by foolish honesty and love, I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep. There are a kind of men So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter

Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio. In sleep I heard him say "Sweet Desdemona, Let us be wary, let us hide our loves." And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, Cry "O sweet creature!" and then kiss me hard, As if he plucked up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips, lay his leg Over my thigh, and sigh, and kiss, and then Cry "Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!"
 
Oh, monstrous! Monstrous!
 
Nay, this was but his dream.
 
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
 
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly.
 
I'll tear her all to pieces!
 
Nay, yet be wise, yet we see nothing done, She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
 
I gave her such a one, 'twas my first gift.
 
I know not that, but such a handkerchief- I am sure it was your wife's-did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with.
 
If it be that-
 
If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs.

Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives! One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago, All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 'Tis gone. Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell! Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
 
Yet be content.
 
Oh, blood, blood, blood!
 
Patience, I say. Your mind may change.
 
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea, Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er keeps retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont, Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up. Now, by yon marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words. <i>(he kneels)</i>
 
Do not rise yet. Witness, you ever-burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wronged Othello's service. Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever.

I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to 't. Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive.
 
My friend is dead, 'Tis done at your request. But let her live.
 
Damn her, lewd minx! Oh, damn her, damn her! Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
 
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
 
Why, man?
 
He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, 'tis stabbing.
 
Go to. Where lodges he?
 
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
 
Can anything be made of this?
 
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
 
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
 
I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.
 
Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
 
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.

Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
 
I know not, madam.
 
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.
 
Is he not jealous?
 
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.
 
Look where he comes.
 
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him.-How is 't with you, my lord?
 
Well, my good lady.-<i>(aside)</i> Oh, hardness to dissemble!- How do you, Desdemona?
 
Well, my good lord.
 
Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
 
It hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
 
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart. Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,

Much castigation, exercise devout, For here's a young and sweating devil here, That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, A frank one.
 
You may indeed say so, For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
 
A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
 
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
 
What promise, chuck?
 
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
 
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me. Lend me thy handkerchief.
 
Here, my lord.
 
That which I gave you.
 
I have it not about me.
 
Not?
 
No, indeed, my lord.
 
That's a fault. That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give, She was a charmer and could almost read

The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made gift of it, my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me And bid me, when my fate would have me wived, To give it her. I did so, and take heed on 't, Make it a darling like your precious eye. To lose 't or give 't away were such perdition As nothing else could match.
 
Is 't possible?
 
'Tis true. There's magic in the web of it. A sibyl, that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sewed the work. The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens' hearts.
 
Indeed? Is 't true?
 
Most veritable, therefore look to 't well.
 
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen 't!
 
Ha! Wherefore?
 
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

Fetch 't, let me see 't.
 
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. This is a trick to put me from my suit. Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
 
Fetch me the handkerchief-my mind misgives.
 
Come, come, You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
 
The handkerchief!
 
A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, Shared dangers with you-
 
The handkerchief!
 
In sooth, you are to blame.
 
Away!
 
Is not this man jealous?

I ne'er saw this before. Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief, I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
 
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man. They are all but stomachs, and we all but food. To eat us hungerly, and when they are full, They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!
 
There is no other way. 'Tis she must do 't, And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.
 
How now, good Cassio, what's the news with you?
 
Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist, and be a member of his love Whom I, with all the office of my heart Entirely honor. I would not be delayed. If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past, nor present sorrows, Nor purposed merit in futurity, Can ransom me into his love again, But to know so must be my benefit. So shall I clothe me in a forced content, And shut myself up in some other course, To fortune's alms.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 182 --%%--
 
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio, My advocation is not now in tune. My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered. So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech. You must awhile be patient. What I can do I will, and more I will Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.
 
Is my lord angry?
 
He went hence but now, And certainly in strange unquietness.
 
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And, like the devil, from his very arm Puffed his own brother-and is he angry? Something of moment then, I will go meet him. There's matter in 't indeed, if he be angry.
 
I prithee, do so.
 
Something, sure, of state, Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so, For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods, Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, I was, unhandsome warrior as I am, Arraigning his unkindness with my soul, But now I find I had suborned the witness, And he's indicted falsely.

Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
 
But jealous souls will not be answered so. They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they're jealous. It is a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.
 
Heaven keep the monster from Othello's mind!
 
Lady, amen.
 
I will go seek him.-Cassio, walk hereabout. If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
 
I humbly thank your ladyship.

What make you from home? How is 't with you, my most fair Bianca? Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
 
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights? Eight score eight hours? And lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times! Oh weary reckoning!
 
Pardon me, Bianca, I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed, But I shall, in a more continuate time, Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,  <i>(giving her</i> DESDEMONA<i>'s handkerchief)</i>  Take me this work out.
 
O Cassio, whence came this? This is some token from a newer friend! To the felt absence now I feel a cause. Is 't come to this? Well, well.
 
Go to, woman, Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth From whence you have them. You are jealous now That this is from some mistress, some remembrance. No, in good troth, Bianca.
 
Why, whose is it?
 
I know not neither, I found it in my chamber. I like the work well. Ere it be demanded, As like enough it will, I would have it copied. Take it and do 't, and leave me for this time.
 
Leave you! Wherefore?

I do attend here on the general And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me womaned.
 
Why, I pray you?
 
Not that I love you not.
 
But that you do not love me. I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night.
 
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here. But I'll see you soon.
 
'Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.

Will you think so?
 
Think so, Iago?
 
What, To kiss in private?
 
An unauthorized kiss!
 
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
 
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm! It is hypocrisy against the devil. They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
 
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip. But if I give my wife a handkerchief-
 
What then?
 
Why then 'tis hers, my lord, and, being hers, She may, I think, bestow 't on any man.
 
She is protectress of her honor too. May she give that?

Her honor is an essence that's not seen, They have it very oft that have it not. But for the handkerchief-
 
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. Thou saidst-Oh, it comes o'er my memory, As doth the raven o'er the infectious house, Boding to all-he had my handkerchief.
 
Ay, what of that?
 
That's not so good now.
 
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong? Or heard him say-as knaves be such abroad, Who having, by their own importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose But they must blab-
 
Hath he said any thing?
 
He hath, my lord, but be you well assured No more than he'll unswear.
 
What hath he said?
 
Why, that he did-I know not what he did.
 
What? what?
 
Lie-
 
With her?

With her, on her, what you will.
 
Lie with her? lie on her? We say "lie on her" when they belie her! Lie with her-that's fulsome. Handkerchief-confessions-handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labor. First to be hanged, and then to confess-I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is 't possible? Confess!-Handkerchief!-Oh, devil!-
 
Work on, My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught, And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach.-What, ho! My lord! My lord, I say! Othello!
 
How now, Cassio!
 
What's the matter?
 
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy. This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.
 
Rub him about the temples.
 
No, forbear. The lethargy must have his quiet course. If not, he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs. Do you withdraw yourself a little while,

He will recover straight. When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you.
 
How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?
 
Dost thou mock me?
 
I mock you not, by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
 
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
 
There's many a beast then in a populous city, And many a civil monster.
 
Did he confess it?
 
Good sir, be a man, Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you. There's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better. Oh, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock, To lip a wanton in a secure couch, And to suppose her chaste. No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
 
Oh, thou art wise! 'Tis certain.
 
Stand you awhile apart, Confine yourself but in a patient list. Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief- A passion most resulting such a man- Cassio came hither. I shifted him away And laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 198 --%%--
 
Bade him anon return and here speak with me, The which he promised. Do but encave yourself, And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns That dwell in every region of his face. For I will make him tell the tale anew Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is again to cope your wife. I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience, Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man.
 
Dost thou hear, Iago? I will be found most cunning in my patience, But-dost thou hear?-most bloody.
 
That's not amiss, But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
 
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one. He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
 
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad. And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behavior Quite in the wrong.-How do you now, lieutenant?

Alas, poor caitiff!
 
Look how he laughs already!
 
I never knew woman love man so.
 
Alas, poor rogue, I think indeed she loves me.
 
Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
 
Do you hear, Cassio?
 
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er. Go to, well said, well said.
 
She gives it out that you shall marry her. Do you intend it?
 
Ha, ha, ha!
 
Do ye triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
 
I marry her! What? A customer? Prithee bear some charity to my wit. Do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!

Have you scored me? Well.
 
This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
 
Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.
 
She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck-
 
Crying "O dear Cassio!" as it were. His gesture imports it.
 
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so shakes, and pulls me! Ha, ha, ha!
 
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. Oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
 
Well, I must leave her company.
 
Before me! Look, where she comes.

'Tis such another fitchew. Marry, a perfumed one.- What do you mean by this haunting of me?
 
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you had it, I'll take out no work on 't.

Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again-This night, Iago!
 
Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.

No, as I shall be saved.

Oh, heaven forgive us!
 
I cry you mercy, then, I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello.-You, mistress, That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell!
 
You, you, ay, you! We have done our course. There's money for your pains. I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

With who?
 
Why, with my lord, madam.
 
Who is thy lord?
 
He that is yours, sweet lady.
 
I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia. I cannot weep, nor answers have I none, But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember, And call thy husband hither.
 
Here's a change indeed!
 
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet. How have I been behaved that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
 
What is your pleasure, madam? How is 't with you?

Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, That true hearts cannot bear it.
 
Am I that name, Iago?
 
What name, fair lady?
 
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
 
He called her "whore." A beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
 
Why did he so?
 
I do not know. I am sure I am none such.
 
Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
 
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country, and her friends, To be called "whore"? Would it not make one weep?
 
It is my wretched fortune.
 
Beshrew him for 't! How comes this trick upon him?
 
Nay, heaven doth know.
 
I will be hanged, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else!

Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.
 
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
 
A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones! Why should he call her "whore"? Who keeps her company? What place? What time? What form? What likelihood? The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. O heavens, that such companions thou'dst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th' west!
 
Speak within door.
 
Oh, fie upon them! Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
 
You are a fool. Go to.
 
Alas Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again? Good friend, go to him. For, by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them, or any other form, Or that I do not yet, and ever did,

And ever will-though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement-love him dearly, Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much, And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love. I cannot say "whore," It does abhor me now I speak the word. To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
 
I pray you, be content, 'tis but his humor. The business of the state does him offence, And he does chide with you.
 
If 'twere no other-
 
'Tis but so, I warrant.
 
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper. The messengers of Venice stays the meat. Go in, and weep not. All things shall be well.

I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
 
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
 
I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.
 
You charge me most unjustly.
 
With naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
 
Well, go to. Very well.
 
"Very well," "go to"! I cannot go to, man, nor 'tis not very well. Nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.
 
Very well.
 
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
 
You have said now.
 
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.

Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
 
It hath not appeared.
 
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever-I mean purpose, courage and valor-this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
 
Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
 
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
 
Is that true? Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
 
Oh, no, he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident-wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
 
How do you mean, removing of him?
 
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place: knocking out his brains.
 
And that you would have me to do!

Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him.

Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be returned Forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there, look 't be done.

He says he will return incontinent, And hath commanded me to go to bed And bid me to dismiss you.

My mother had a maid called Barbary, She was in love, and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her. She had a song of "Willow," An old thing 'twas, but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it. That song tonight Will not go from my mind. I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.

And pour our treasures into foreign laps, Or else break out in peevish jealousies, Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite. Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them. They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have. What is it that they do When they change us for others? Is it sport? I think it is. And doth affection breed it? I think it doth. Is 't frailty that thus errs? It is so too. And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? Then let them use us well, else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it, And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand, It was a handkerchief, an antique token My father gave my mother.
 
Oh, heaven! Oh, heavenly powers!
 
Zounds, hold your peace.

Oh, villain!
 
Most heathenish and most gross!
 
Now here's another discontented paper Found in his pocket too, and this, it seems, Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain But that, belike, Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him.
 
O thou pernicious caitiff! How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief That was my wife's?
 
I found it in my chamber, And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire.

There is besides in Roderigo's letter How he upbraids Iago, that he made him Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came That I was cast. And even but now he spake, After long seeming dead-Iago hurt him, Iago set him on.
 
<i>(to</i> OTHELLO<i>)</i> You must forsake this room and go with us. Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus.

I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.

Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York, And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths, Our bruised arms hung up for monuments, Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front; And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court an amorous looking glass; I, that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them- Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, Have no delight to pass away the time, Unless to see my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 4 --%%--
 
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days, I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days. Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate, the one against the other; And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that "G" Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be. Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.
 
Brother, good day. What means this armed guard That waits upon your Grace?
 
His majesty, Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
 
Upon what cause?
 
Because my name is George.
 
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours. He should, for that, commit your godfathers. O, belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower. But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 6 --%%--
 
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest As yet I do not. But, as I can learn, He hearkens after prophecies and dreams, And from the crossrow plucks the letter <i>G</i>, And says a wizard told him that by "G" His issue disinherited should be. And for my name of George begins with <i>G</i>, It follows in his thought that I am he. These, as I learn, and such like toys as these Have moved his Highness to commit me now.
 
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women. 'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower. My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she That tempers him to this extremity. Was it not she and that good man of worship, Anthony Woodeville, her brother there, That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, From whence this present day he is delivered? We are not safe, Clarence. We are not safe.
 
By heaven, I think there is no man is secure But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore. Heard ye not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
 
Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty. I'll tell you what: I think it is our way, If we will keep in favor with the king, To be her men and wear her livery. The jealous o'erworn widow and herself, Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen, Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 8 --%%--
 
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me. His majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference, Of what degree soever, with his brother.
 
Even so. An please your Worship, Brakenbury, You may partake of anything we say. We speak no treason, man. We say the king Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous. We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot, A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue, And that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks. How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
 
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
 
Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow, He that doth naught with her, excepting one, Were best he do it secretly, alone.
 
What one, my lord?
 
Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?
 
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
 
We are the queen's abjects and must obey.- Brother, farewell. I will unto the king, And whatsoe'er you will employ me in, Were it to call King Edward's widow "sister," I will perform it to enfranchise you. Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
 
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
 
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long. I will deliver you or else lie for you. Meantime, have patience.
 
I must perforce. Farewell.
 
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, If heaven will take the present at our hands. But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
 
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
 
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain. Well are you welcome to the open air. How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 12 --%%--
 
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must. But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment.
 
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too, For they that were your enemies are his And have prevailed as much on him as you.
 
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
 
What news abroad?
 
No news so bad abroad as this at home: The king is sickly, weak and melancholy, And his physicians fear him mightily.
 
Now, by Saint Paul, that news is bad indeed. O, he hath kept an evil diet long, And overmuch consumed his royal person. 'Tis very grievous to be thought upon. Where is he, in his bed?
 
He is.
 
Go you before, and I will follow you.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 14 --%%--
 
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven. I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence With lies well steeled with weighty arguments, And, if I fail not in my deep intent, Clarence hath not another day to live; Which done, God take King Edward to His mercy, And leave the world for me to bustle in. For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter. What though I killed her husband and her father? The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father; The which will I, not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto. But yet I run before my horse to market. Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns. When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.

Ay, madam. He desires to make atonement Betwixt the duke of Gloucester and your brothers, And betwixt them and my Lord Chamberlain, And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
 
Would all were well-but that will never be. I fear our happiness is at the height.
 
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it! Who is it that complains unto the king That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not? By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors. Because I cannot flatter and look fair, Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog, Duck with French nods and apish courtesy, I must be held a rancorous enemy. Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken, sly, insinuating jacks?
 
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace?
 
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace. When have I injured thee? When done thee wrong?- Or thee?-Or thee? Or any of your faction? A plague upon you all! His royal grace, Whom God preserve better than you would wish, Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter. The king, on his own royal disposition, And not provoked by any suitor else, Aiming belike at your interior hatred That in your outward actions shows itself Against my children, brothers, and myself, Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.
 
I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch. Since every jack became a gentleman, There's many a gentle person made a jack.
 
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester. You envy my advancement, and my friends'. God grant we never may have need of you.
 
Meantime God grants that we have need of you. Our brother is imprisoned by your means, Myself disgraced, and the nobility Held in contempt, while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
 
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed, I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence, but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him. My lord, you do me shameful injury Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs. By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured.

The curse my noble father laid on thee When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper, And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes, And then, to dry them, gav'st the duke a clout Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland- His curses then, from bitterness of soul Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee, And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven That Henry's death, my Lovelly Edward's death, Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment, Could all but answer for that peevish brat?

Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong. I was too hot to do somebody good That is too cold in thinking of it now. Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid; He is franked up to fatting for his pains. God pardon them that are the cause thereof.

Why looks your grace so heavily today?
 
O, I have passed a miserable night, So full of ugly dreams, of ugly sights, That, as I am a Christian faithful man, I would not spend another such a night Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days, So full of dismal terror was the time.
 
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
 
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy, And in my company my brother Gloucester, Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times, During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us. As we paced along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main. O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown, What dreadful noise of waters in my ears, What sights of ugly death within my eyes. Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks, A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon, Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 76 --%%--
 
Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept- As 'twere in scorn of eyes-reflecting gems, That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.
 
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
 
Methought I had, and often did I strive To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air, But smothered it within my panting bulk, Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
 
Awaked you not in this sore agony?
 
No, no, my dream was lengthened after life. O, then began the tempest to my soul. I passed, methought, the melancholy flood, With that sour ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. The first that there did greet my stranger-soul Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick, Who spake aloud, "What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?" And so he vanished. Then came wand'ring by A shadow like an angel, with bright hair Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked out aloud
 
--%%-- pageNum: 78 --%%--
 
"Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury. Seize on him, furies. Take him unto torment." With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends Environed me and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling waked, and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell, Such terrible impression made my dream.
 
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you. I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
 
Ah keeper, keeper, I have done those things, That now give evidence against my soul, For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me.- O God, if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, Yet execute thy wrath in me alone! O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!- Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile. My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
 
I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.

'Tis better, sir, to be brief than tedious.-Let him see our commission, and talk no more.
 
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands. I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless from the meaning. There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.  <i>He hands them the keys</i>  I'll to the king and signify to him That thus I have resigned my charge to you.

The urging of that word "judgment" hath bred a kind of remorse in me.

Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
 
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
 
So I am-to let him live.
 
I'll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
 
Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humor of mine will change. It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.

So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
 
'Tis no matter. Let it go. There's few or none will entertain it.
 
What if it come to thee again?
 
I'll not meddle with it. It makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbor's wife but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom. It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing, and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.
 
Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the duke.

Happy indeed, as we have spent the day. Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity, Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate, Between these swelling, wrong-incensed peers.

A blessed labor, my most sovereign lord. Amongst this princely heap, if any here By false intelligence, or wrong surmise Hold me a foe, If I unwittingly, or in my rage, Have aught committed that is hardly borne By any in this presence, I desire To reconcile me to his friendly peace. 'Tis death to me to be at enmity; I hate it, and desire all good men's love. First, madam, I entreat true peace of you, Which I will purchase with my duteous service;- Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, If ever any grudge were lodged between us;- Of you and you, Lord Rivers and of Dorset, That all without desert have frowned on me;- Of you, Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales;- of you, Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all. I do not know that Englishman alive With whom my soul is any jot at odds More than the infant that is born tonight. I thank my God for my humility.
 
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter. I would to God all strifes were well compounded. My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
 
Why, madam, have I offered love for this, To be so flouted in this royal presence? Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
 
You do him injury to scorn his corse.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 108 --%%--
 
Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?
 
All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
 
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
 
Ay, my good lord, and no one in the presence But his red color hath forsook his cheeks.
 
Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed.
 
But he, poor man, by your first order died, And that a winged Mercury did bear. Some tardy cripple bear the countermand, That came too lag to see him buried. God grant that some, less noble and less loyal, Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood, Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, And yet go current from suspicion.
 
<i>(kneeling)</i> A boon, my sovereign, for my service done.
 
I prithee, peace. My soul is full of sorrow.
 
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
 
Then say at once what is it thou requests.
 
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life, Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk.

Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death, And shall the tongue give pardon to a slave? My brother killed no man; his fault was thought, And yet his punishment was bitter death. Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath, Kneeled at my feet, and bade me be advised? Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love? Who told me how the poor soul did forsake The mighty Warwick and did fight for me? Who told me, in the field by Tewkesbury, When Oxford had me down, he rescued me, And said "Dear brother, live, and be a king"? Who told me, when we both lay in the field Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me Even in his garments and did give himself, All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night? All this from my remembrance brutish wrath Sinfully plucked, and not a man of you Had so much grace to put it in my mind. But when your carters or your waiting vassals Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced The precious image of our dear Redeemer, You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon, And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.  <i>Stanley rises</i>  But for my brother, not a man would speak, Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all Have been beholding to him in his life, Yet none of you would once beg for his life. O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold On me and you, and mine and yours for this!- Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.- Ah, poor Clarence.

This is the fruits of rashness. Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death? O, they did urge it still unto the king. God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go To comfort Edward with our company?
 
We wait upon your Grace.

Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
 
No, boy.
 
Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast, And cry, "O Clarence, my unhappy son?"
 
Why do you look on us and shake your head, And call us orphans, wretches, castaways, If that our noble father were alive?
 
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both. I do lament the sickness of the king, As loath to lose him, not your father's death. It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
 
Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead. The king mine uncle is to blame for it. God will revenge it, whom I will importune With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
 
And so will I.
 
Peace, children, peace. The king doth love you well. Incapable and shallow innocents, You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 116 --%%--
 
Grandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester Told me the king, provoked to it by the queen, Devised impeachments to imprison him; And when my uncle told me so, he wept, And pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek, Bade me rely on him as on my father, And he would love me dearly as a child.
 
Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape, And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice. He is my son, ay, and therein my shame, Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
 
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
 
Ay, boy.
 
I cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?
 
Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep, To chide my fortune and torment myself? I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy.
 
What means this scene of rude impatience?
 
To make an act of tragic violence. Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead. Why grow the branches when the root is gone? Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 118 --%%--
 
If you will live, lament. If die, be brief, That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's, Or, like obedient subjects, follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
 
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband. I have bewept a worthy husband's death And lived with looking on his images; But now two mirrors of his princely semblance Are cracked in pieces by malignant death, And I, for comfort, have but one false glass That grieves me when I see my shame in him. Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother, And hast the comfort of thy children left, But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands, Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I, Thine being but a moiety of my moan, To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!
 
<i>(to</i> QUEEN ELIZABETH<i>)</i> Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death. How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
 
Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned. Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept!
 
Give me no help in lamentation. I am not barren to bring forth complaints. All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I, being governed by the watery moon, May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world. Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 120 --%%--
 
Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
 
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
 
What stay had I but Edward? And he's gone.
 
What stay had we but Clarence? And he's gone.
 
What stays had I but they? And they are gone.
 
Was never widow had so dear a loss.
 
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
 
Was never mother had so dear a loss. Alas, I am the mother of these griefs. Their woes are parceled; mine are general. She for an Edward weeps, and so do I; I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she. These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; I for an Edward weep; so do not they. Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed, Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow's nurse, And I will pamper it with lamentations.

<i>(to</i> QUEEN ELIZABETH<i>)</i> Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeased That you take with unthankfulness, his doing. In common worldly things, 'tis called ungrateful With dull unwillingness to repay a debt Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent; Much more to be thus opposite with heaven, For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
 
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him. Let him be crowned. In him your comfort lives. Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
 
Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star, But none can help our harms by wailing them.- Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing.
 
God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast, Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.
 
<i>(standing)</i> Amen. <i>(aside)</i> And make me die a good old man! That is the butt end of a mother's blessing; I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.

You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, Now cheer each other in each other's love. Though we have spent our harvest of this king, We are to reap the harvest of his son. The broken rancor of your high-swoll'n hates, But lately splintered, knit, and joined together, Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept. Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London, to be crowned our king.
 
Why "with some little train," my Lord of Buckingham?
 
Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude The new-healed wound of malice should break out, Which would be so much the more dangerous By how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned. Where every horse bears his commanding rein And may direct his course as please himself, As well the fear of harm as harm apparent, In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
 
I hope the king made peace with all of us; And the compact is firm and true in me.
 
And so in me, and so, I think, in all. Yet since it is but green, it should be put To no apparent likelihood of breach, Which haply by much company might be urged. Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
 
And so say I.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 126 --%%--
 
Then be it so, and go we to determine Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.- Madam, and you, my sister, will you go To give your censures in this business?
 
My lord, whoever journeys to the prince, For God's sake let not us two at home. For by the way I'll sort occasion, As index to the story we late talked of, To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince.
 
My other self, my council's consistory, My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin, I, as a child, will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
 
I promise you I scarcely know myself. Hear you the news abroad?
 
Yes, that the king is dead.
 
Ill news, by 'r Lady. Seldom comes the better. I fear, I fear, 'twill prove a giddy world.
 
Neighbors, God speed.
 
Give you good morrow, sir.
 
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
 
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.
 
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
 
No, no, by God's good grace, his son shall reign.
 
Woe to the land that's governed by a child.
 
In him there is a hope of government, Which, in his nonage, council under him, And, in his full and ripened years, himself, No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.

So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.
 
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot, For then this land was famously enriched With politic grave counsel; then the king Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
 
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
 
Better it were they all came by his father, Or by the father there were none at all, For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not. O, full of danger is the duke of Gloucester, And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud, And were they to be ruled, and not to rule, This sickly land might solace as before.
 
Come, come, we fear the worst. All will be well.
 
When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks; When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand; When the sun sets, who doth not look for night? Untimely storms make men expect a dearth. All may be well; but if God sort it so, 'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
 
Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear. Ye cannot reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and full of dread.

And so was I. I'll bear you company.

Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford, And at Northampton they do rest tonight. Tomorrow or next day they will be here.
 
I long with all my heart to see the prince. I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
 
But I hear no; they say my son of York Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
 
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.
 
Why, my young cousin? It is good to grow.
 
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper, My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother: "Ay," quoth my uncle Gloucester, "Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace." And since, methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
 
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee! He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
 
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 136 --%%--
 
I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.
 
Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered, I could have given my uncle's grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.
 
How, my pretty York? I prithee let me hear it.
 
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old. 'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth. Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
 
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
 
Grandam, his nurse.
 
His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.
 
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
 
A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd.
 
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
 
Pitchers have ears.

Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret, And, with them, Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
 
Who hath committed them?
 
The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
 
For what offence?
 
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed. Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
 
Ay me! I see the ruin of my house. The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind. Insulting tyranny begins to jut Upon the innocent and aweless throne. Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre. I see, as in a map, the end of all.

Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

No, uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy. I want more uncles here to welcome me.
 
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit; Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show, which, God He knows, Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. Those uncles which you want were dangerous. Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts. God keep you from them, and from such false friends.
 
God keep me from false friends, but they were none.

I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.- I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way. Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!
 
And in good time here comes the sweating lord.
 
Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
 
On what occasion God He knows, not I, The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary. The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace, But by his mother was perforce withheld.
 
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers! -Lord Cardinal, will your Grace Persuade the queen to send the duke of York Unto his princely brother presently?- If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him, And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
 
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the duke of York, Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 146 --%%--
 
You are too senseless obstinate, my lord, Too ceremonious and traditional. Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him. The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place And those who have the wit to claim the place. This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it. Then taking him from thence that is not there, You break no privilege nor charter there. Oft have I heard of sanctuary men, But sanctuary children, ne'er till now.
 
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.- Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
 
I go, my lord.
 
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
 
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
 
Where it seems best unto your royal self. If I may counsel you, some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower; Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation.
 
I do not like the Tower, of any place.- Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 148 --%%--
 
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
 
Is it upon record, or else reported Successively from age to age, he built it?
 
Upon record, my gracious lord.
 
But say, my lord, it were not registered, Methinks the truth should live from age to age, As 'twere retailed to all posterity, Even to the general all-ending day.
 
<i>(aside)</i> So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
 
What say you, uncle?
 
I say, without characters fame lives long.  <i>(aside)</i> Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity, I moralize two meanings in one word.
 
That Julius Caesar was a famous man. With what his valor did enrich his wit, His wit set down to make his valor live. Death makes no conquest of this conqueror, For now he lives in fame, though not in life. I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-

Now in good time here comes the duke of York.
 
Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
 
Well, my dread lord-so must I call you now.
 
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours. Too late he died that might have kept that title, Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
 
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
 
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth. The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
 
He hath, my lord.
 
And therefore is he idle?

O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
 
Then is he more beholding to you than I.
 
He may command me as my sovereign, But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
 
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
 
My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.
 
A beggar, brother?
 
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give, And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
 
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
 
A greater gift? O, that's the sword to it.
 
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
 
O, then I see you will part but with light gifts. In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
 
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
 
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
 
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
 
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
 
How?

Little.
 
My lord of York will still be cross in talk. Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
 
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.- Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me. Because that I am little, like an ape, He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
 
<i>(aside)</i> With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, He prettily and aptly taunts himself. So cunning and so young is wonderful.

<i>(to</i> PRINCE<i>)</i> What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
 
My lord protector needs will have it so.
 
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
 
Why, what should you fear?
 
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost. My grandam told me he was murdered there.

Think you, my lord, this little prating York Was not incensed by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
 
No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable. He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
 
Well, let them rest.-Come hither, Catesby. Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart. Thou knowest our reasons, urged upon the way. What thinkest thou? Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the installment of this noble duke In the seat royal of this famous isle?
 
He, for his father's sake, so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him.

Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation. If thou dost find him tractable to us, Encourage him and show him all our reasons. If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling, Be thou so too, and so break off the talk, And give us notice of his inclination; For we tomorrow hold divided councils, Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.
 
Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby, His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret castle, And bid my lord, for joy of this good news, Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

So it appears by that I have to say. First, he commends him to your noble self.

Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razed his helm Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other. Therefore he sends to know your Lordship's pleasure, If you will presently take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north To shun the danger that his soul divines.

Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord. Bid him not fear the separated council. His Honor and myself are at the one, And at the other is my good friend Catesby, Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence. Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance. And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers. To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase. Go, bid thy master rise and come to me, And we will both together to the Tower, Where he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
 
I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
 
Many good morrows to my noble lord.
 
Good morrow, Catesby. You are early stirring. What news, what news in this our tott'ring state?
 
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
 
How "wear the garland"? Dost thou mean the crown?

Ay, my good lord.
 
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I'll see the crown so foul misplaced. But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
 
Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof; And thereupon he sends you this good news, That this same very day your enemies, The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
 
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries. But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side To bar my master's heirs in true descent, God knows I will not do it, to the death.
 
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.
 
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, That they which brought me in my master's hate, I live to look upon their tragedy. Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't.
 
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, When men are unprepared and look not for it.
 
O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I, who, as thou know'st, are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

Come on, come on. Where is your boar-spear, man? Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
 
My lord, good morrow. -Good morrow, Catesby.- You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood, I do not like these several councils, I.
 
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as 'tis now. Think you but that I know our state secure, I would be so triumphant as I am?
 
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London, Were jocund and supposed their states were sure, And they indeed had no cause to mistrust; But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast. This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt. Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward! What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.

Come, come. Have with you. Wot you what, my lord? Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.
 
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats. But come, my lord, let's away.
 
Go on before. I'll talk with this good fellow.
 
How now, sirrah! How goes the world with thee?
 
The better that your Lordship please to ask.
 
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet. Then was I going prisoner to the TowerBy the suggestion of the queen's allies. But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself- This day those enemies are put to death, And I in better state than e'er I was.
 
God hold it, to your Honor's good content!
 
Gramercy, fellow. There, drink that for me.
 
I thank your Honor.

Well met, my lord. I am glad to see your Honor.
 
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart. I am in your debt for your last exercise. Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.
 
I'll wait upon your Lordship
 
What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain? Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.
 
Good faith, and when I met this holy man, The men you talk of came into my mind. What, go you toward the Tower?
 
I do, my lord, but long I shall not stay there. I shall return before your Lordship thence.
 
Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.

Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this: Today shalt thou behold a subject die For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

Dispatch. The limit of your lives is out.
 
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison, Fatal and ominous to noble peers! Within the guilty closure of thy walls, Richard the Second here was hacked to death, And, for more slander to thy dismal seat, We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
 
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads, When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I, For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.
 
Then cursed she Richard, then cursed she Buckingham. Then cursed she Hastings. O, remember, God, To hear her prayer for them, as now for us! And for my sister and her princely sons, Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

Now, noble peers. the cause why we are met Is to determine of the coronation. In God's name, speak. When is the royal day?
 
Is all things ready for the royal time?
 
It is, and wants but nomination.
 
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.
 
Who knows the Lord Protector's mind herein? Who is most inward with the noble duke?
 
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
 
We know each other's faces; for our hearts, He knows no more of mine than I of yours, Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.- Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
 
I thank his Grace. I know he loves me well. But for his purpose in the coronation, I have not sounded him, nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein. But you, my honorable lords, may name the time, And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice, Which I presume he'll take in gentle part.

In happy time here comes the duke himself.
 
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. I have been long a sleeper; but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concluded.
 
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part- I mean your voice for crowning of the king.
 
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder. His Lordship knows me well, and loves me well.- My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there; I do beseech you, send for some of them.
 
Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
 
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.  <i>They move aside</i>  Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business And finds the testy gentleman so hot As he will lose his head ere give consent His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it, Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

We have not yet set down this day of triumph. Tomorrow, in my judgement, is too sudden, For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be, were the day prolonged.
 
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester? I have sent for these strawberries.
 
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning. There's some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit. I think there's never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
 
What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today?
 
Marry, that with no man here he is offended, For were he, he had shown it in his looks.
 
I pray God he be not, I say.
 
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms?

The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be. I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
 
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.  <i>(shows his arm)</i>  Look how I am bewitched! Behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling withered up; And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore, That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
 
If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
 
If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet, Talk'st thou to me of "ifs"? Thou art a traitor- Off with his head. Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same.- Lovell and Ratcliffe, look that it be done.- The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
 
Woe, woe for England! Not a whit for me, For I, too fond, might have prevented this. Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm, And I did scorn it and disdain to fly. Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble, And started when he looked upon the Tower, As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse. O, now I need the priest that spake to me!

I now repent I told the pursuivant, As too triumphing, how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered, And I myself secure in grace and favor. O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head.
 
Come, come, dispatch. The duke would be at dinner. Make a short shrift. He longs to see your head.
 
O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
 
Come, come, dispatch. 'Tis bootless to exclaim.
 
O bloody Richard! Miserable England, I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon.- Come, lead me to the block. Bear him my head. They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian, Speak, and look back, and pry on every side, Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks Are at my service, like enforced smiles, And both are ready in their offices, At any time to grace my stratagems. But what, is Catesby gone?
 
He is; and see, he brings the mayor along.
 
Lord Mayor-
 
Look to the drawbridge there!
 
Hark, a drum!
 
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
 
Look back! Defend thee! Here are enemies.
 
God and our innocence defend and guard us!
 
Be patient. They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.
 
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
 
So dear I loved the man that I must weep. I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breathed upon this earth a Christian; Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts. So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That, his apparent open guilt omitted- I mean his conversation with Shore's wife- He lived from all attainder of suspects.
 
Well, well, he was the covert'st sheltered traitor That ever lived.- Would you imagine, or almost believe, Were 't not that by great preservation We live to tell it, that subtle traitor This day had plotted, in the council house To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
 
Had he done so?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 192 --%%--
 
What, think you we are Turks or infidels? Or that we would, against the form of law, Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death, But that the extreme peril of the case, The peace of England and our persons' safety Enforced us to this execution?
 
Now fair befall you! He deserved his death, And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
 
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore. Yet had we not determined he should die Until your Lordship came to see his end (Which now the loving haste of these our friends, Something against our meaning, have prevented), Because, my lord, I would have had you heard The traitor speak, and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons, That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens, who haply may Misconstrue us in him, and wail his death.
 
But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak; And do not doubt, right noble princes both, But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case.
 
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T' avoid the censures of the carping world.

Which since you come too late of our intent, Yet witness what you hear we did intend. And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
 
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post. There, at your meetest vantage of the time, Infer the bastardy of Edward's children. Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crown-meaning indeed his house, Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so. Moreover, urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust, Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, Even where his raging eye or savage heart, Without control, lusted to make his prey. Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward, noble York My princely father then had wars in France, And, by true computation of the time, Found that the issue was not his begot, Which well appeared in his lineaments, Being nothing like the noble duke my father. Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off, Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.

Doubt not, my lord. I'll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself. And so, my lord, adieu.
 
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle, Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
 
I go; and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
 
Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.  <i>(to</i> RATCLIFFE<i>)</i> Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
 
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes.

This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed, That it may be today read o'er in Paul's. And mark how well the sequel hangs together: Eleven hours I have spent to write it over, For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me; The precedent was full as long a-doing, And yet within these five hours Hastings lived, Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty. Here's a good world the while. Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device? Yet who so bold but says he sees it not? Bad is the world, and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 200 --%%--
 
How now, how now? What say the citizens?
 
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, The citizens are mum, say not a word.
 
Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children?
 
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France; Th' unsatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives; His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, As being got, your father then in France, His resemblance being not like the duke. Withal, I did infer your lineaments, Being the right idea of your father, Both in your form and nobleness of mind; Laid open all your victories in Scotland, Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, Your bounty, virtue, fair humility; Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse. And when mine oratory grew toward end, I bid them that did love their country's good Cry "God save Richard, England's royal king!"
 
And did they so?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 202 --%%--
 
No. So God help me, they spake not a word But, like dumb statues or breathing stones, Stared each on other and looked deadly pale; Which when I saw, I reprehended them And asked the mayor what meant this willful silence. His answer was, the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder. Then he was urged to tell my tale again: "Thus saith the duke. Thus hath the duke inferred"- But nothing spoke in warrant from himself. When he had done, some followers of mine own, At the lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps, And some ten voices cried "God save King Richard!" And thus I took the vantage of those few. "Thanks, gentle citizens and friends," quoth I. "This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard"- And even here brake off, and came away.
 
What tongueless blocks were they! Would not they speak? Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
 
The mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear; Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit. And look you get a prayer book in your hand And stand between two churchmen, good my lord, For on that ground I'll make a holy descant. And be not easily won to our requests. Play the maid's part: still answer "nay," and take it.
 
I go. An if you plead as well for them As I can say "nay" to thee for myself, No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.

Go, go, up to the leads. The Lord Mayor knocks.
 
Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here. I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
 
Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
 
He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord, To visit him tomorrow or next day. He is within, with two right reverend fathers, Divinely bent to meditation, And in no worldly suits would he be moved To draw him from his holy exercise.
 
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke. Tell him myself, the mayor, and aldermen, No less importing than our general good, In deep designs, and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace.
 
I'll signify so much unto him straight.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 206 --%%--
 
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward! He is not lolling on a lewd love bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul. Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof. But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.
 
Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!
 
I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.
 
Now, Catesby, what says his grace?
 
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him, His grace not being warned thereof before. He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
 
Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him. By heaven, we come to him in perfect love, And so once more return and tell his grace.
 
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence, So sweet is zealous contemplation.

See where his Grace stands, 'tween two clergymen.
 
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, To stay him from the fall of vanity; And, see, a book of prayer in his hand, True ornaments to know a holy man.- Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince, Lend favorable ears to our requests, And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
 
My lord, there needs no such apology. I do beseech your Grace pardon me, Who, earnest in the service of my God, Deferred the visitation of my friends. But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
 
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungoverned isle.
 
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city's eye, And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
 
You have, my lord. Would it might please your Grace, On our entreaties, to amend your fault.
 
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

Know, then, it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat, the throne majestical, The sceptered office of your ancestors, Your state of fortune, and your due of birth, The lineal glory of your royal house, To the corruption of a blemished stock, Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, Which here we waken to our country's good, The noble isle doth want her proper limbs- Her face defaced with scars of infamy, Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion; Which to recure, we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land, Not as Protector, steward, substitute, Or lowly factor for another's gain, But as successively, from blood to blood, Your right of birth, your empery, your own. For this, consorted with the citizens, Your very worshipful and loving friends, And by their vehement instigation, In this just suit come I to move your Grace.
 
I cannot tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition. If not to answer, you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, Which fondly you would here impose on me. If to reprove you for this suit of yours, So seasoned with your faithful love to me, Then on the other side I checked my friends. Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first, And then, in speaking, not to incur the last, Definitively thus I answer you: Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request. First, if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth, Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, So mighty and so many my defects, That I would rather hide me from my greatness, Being a bark to brook no mighty sea, Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered. But, God be thanked, there is no need of me, And much I need to help you, were there need. The royal tree hath left us royal fruit, Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time, Will well become the seat of majesty, And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign. On him I lay what you would lay on me, The right and fortune of his happy stars, Which God defend that I should wring from him.

My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace, But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, All circumstances well considered. You say that Edward is your brother's son; So say we too, but not by Edward's wife. For first was he contract to Lady Lucy- Your mother lives a witness to that vow- And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona, sister to the king of France. These both put off, a poor petitioner, A care-crazed mother to a many sons, A beauty-waning and distressed widow, Even in the afternoon of her best days, Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy. By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward, whom our manners term "the Prince." More bitterly could I expostulate, Save that, for reverence to some alive, I give a sparing limit to my tongue. Then, good my lord, take to your royal self This proffered benefit of dignity, If not to bless us and the land withal, Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal, true-derived course.

Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.
 
O, make them joyful. Grant their lawful suit.
 
Alas, why would you heap this care on me? I am unfit for state and majesty. I do beseech you, take it not amiss; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.
 
If you refuse it, as in love and zeal Loath to depose the child, your brother's son- As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse, Which we have noted in you to your kindred And equally indeed to all estates- Yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no, Your brother's son shall never reign our king, But we will plant some other in the throne, To the disgrace and downfall of your house. And in this resolution here we leave you.- Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.

Cousin of Buckingham and sage, grave men, Since you will buckle fortune on my back, To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no, I must have patience to endure the load; But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition, Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof, For God doth know, and you may partly see, How far I am from the desire of this.

Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again, Within so small a time my woman's heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words And proved the subject of mine own soul's curse, Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest, For never yet one hour in his bed Did I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep, But with his timorous dreams was still awaked. Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick, And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

Why so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
 
Ha! Am I king? 'Tis so-but Edward lives.
 
True, noble prince.

O bitter consequence That Edward still should live "true noble prince"! Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull. Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead, And I would have it suddenly performed. What sayest thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief.
 
Your Grace may do your pleasure.
 
Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes. Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
 
Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord, Before I positively speak in this. I will resolve you herein presently.

I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit. Gold were as good as twenty orators, And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
 
What is his name?
 
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
 
I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy

How now, Lord Stanley, what's the news?
 
Know, my long lord, The marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
 
Come hither, Catesby. Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick. I will take order for her keeping close. Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter. The boy is foolish, and I fear not him. Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die. About it, for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.

James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
 
Art thou indeed?
 
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
 
Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
 
Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.
 
Why then, thou hast it. Two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers, Are they that I would have thee deal upon. Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
 
Let me have open means to come to them, And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
 
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.
 
Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.

My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.
 
Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
 
I hear the news, my lord.
 
Stanley, he is your wife's son. Well, look unto it.
 
My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, For which your honor and your faith is pawned- Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promised I shall possess.
 
Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
 
What says your Highness to my just request?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 240 --%%--
 
I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, When Richmond was a little peevish boy. A king, perhaps-
 
My lord-
 
How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
 
My lord, your promise for the earldom-
 
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter, The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont, at which name I started, Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
 
My Lord-
 
Ay, what's o'clock?
 
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me.
 
Well, but what's o'clock?
 
Upon the stroke of ten.
 
Well, let it strike.
 
Why let it strike?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 242 --%%--
 
Because that, like a jack, thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation. I am not in the giving vein today.
 
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.
 
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.

The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of. Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery, Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs, Melted with tenderness and mild compassion, Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story. "O thus" quoth Dighton, "lay those gentle babes." "Thus, thus," quoth Forrest, "girdling one another Within their alabaster innocent arms. Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, And in their summer beauty kissed each other. A book of prayers on their pillow lay, Which once," quoth Forrest, "almost changed my mind, But O, the devil-"There the villain stopped; When Dighton thus told on: "We smothered The most replenished sweet work of nature That from the prime creation e'er she framed." Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse; They could not speak; and so I left them both To bear this tidings to the bloody king.
 
And here he comes.-All health, my sovereign lord.
 
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 246 --%%--
 
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness, be happy then, For it is done.
 
But did'st thou see them dead?
 
I did, my lord.
 
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
 
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them, But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
 
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after-supper, When thou shalt tell the process of their death. Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, And be inheritor of thy desire. Farewell till then.
 
I humbly take my leave.
 
The son of Clarence have I pent up close, His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage, The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight. Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter, And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.

My lord!
 
Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so bluntly?
 
Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond, And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen, Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
 
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength. Come, I have learned that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay; Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary; Then fiery expedition be my wing, Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king. Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield. We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes, My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets, If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual, Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother's lamentation.

Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him; Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him.

Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him Then forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death- That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood; That excellent grand tyrant of the earth, That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls; That foul defacer of God's handiwork Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves. O upright, just, and true-disposing God, How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother's body And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
 
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes! God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
 
Bear with me, I am hungry for revenge, And now I cloy me with beholding it. Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward, Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; Young York, he is but boot, because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss. Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward, And the beholders of this frantic play, Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves. Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither. But at hand, at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end. Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray, To have him suddenly conveyed from hence. Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray, That I may live to say, "The dog is dead."

O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!
 
I called thee then "vain flourish of my fortune." I called thee then poor shadow, "painted queen," The presentation of but what I was, The flattering index of a direful pageant, One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below, A mother only mocked with two fair babes, A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot, A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble, A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers? Where are thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy? Who sues and kneels and says "God save the queen?" Where be the bending peers that flattered thee? Where be the thronging troops that followed thee? Decline all this, and see what now thou art: For happy wife, a most distressed widow; For joyful mother, one that wails the name; For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care; For she that scorned at me, now scorned of me; For she being feared of all, now fearing one; For she commanding all, obeyed of none. Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time, Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more, being what thou art. Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke, From which even here I slip my weary head And leave the burthen of it all on thee. Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance. These English woes will make me smile in France.

O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.
 
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; Compare dead happiness with living woe; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is. Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse. Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
 
My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine!
 
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.
 
Why should calamity be full of words?
 
Windy attorneys to their clients' woes, Airy succeeders of intestate joys, Poor breathing orators of miseries, Let them have scope, though what they will impart Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.

And came I not at last to comfort you?
 
No, by the Holy Rood, thou know'st it well. Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell. A grievous burden was thy birth to me; Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; Thy school days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious; Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous; Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody, More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred. What comfortable hour canst thou name, That ever graced me in thy company?

Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse, Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armor that thou wear'st. My prayers on the adverse party fight, And there the little souls of Edward's children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory.

Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you.
 
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard, They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens, And therefore level not to hit their lives.
 
You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
 
And must she die for this? O, let her live, And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward's bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy. So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter, I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
 
Wrong not her birth. She is a royal princess.
 
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
 
Her life is safest only in her birth.
 
And only in that safety died her brothers.
 
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.

Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts, Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction. No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs. But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes, And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death, Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
 
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed!
 
What good is covered with the face of heaven, To be discovered, that can do me good?

Therefore present to her-as sometime Margaret Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland's blood- A handkerchief, which say to her did drain The purple sap from her sweet brother's body, And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal. If this inducement move her not to love, Send her a letter of thy noble deeds; Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence, Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
 
You mock me, madam. This is not the way To win your daughter.
 
There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard, that hath done all this.

A grandam's name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother. They are as children but one step below, Even of your metal, of your very blood, Of all one pain, save for a night of groans Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow. Your children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your age. The loss you have is but a son being king, And by that loss your daughter is made queen. I cannot make you what amends I would; Therefore accept such kindness as I can. Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, This fair alliance quickly shall call home To high promotions and great dignity. The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother. Again shall you be mother to a king, And all the ruins of distressful times Repaired with double riches of content. What, we have many goodly days to see!

God's wrong is most of all. If thou didst fear to break an oath by Him, The unity the king my husband made Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died. If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him, Th' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child, And both the princes had been breathing here, Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms. What canst thou swear by now?

The time to come.
 
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast; For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee. The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered, Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered, Old barren plants, to wail it with their age. Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast Misused ere used, by times ill-used o'erpast.
 
As I intend to prosper and repent, So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound, Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours, Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest, Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if, with dear heart's love, Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter. In her consists my happiness and thine. Without her follows to myself and thee, Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, Death, desolation, ruin and decay. It cannot be avoided but by this; It will not be avoided but by this. Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so- Be the attorney of my love to her: Plead what I will be, not what I have been; Not my deserts, but what I will deserve. Urge the necessity and state of times, And be not peevish found in great designs.

Where is thy power, then, to beat him back? Where be thy tenants and thy followers? Are they not now upon the western shore, Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
 
No, my good lord. My friends are in the north.
 
Cold friends to me. What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
 
They have not been commanded, mighty king. Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
 
Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond, But I'll not trust thee.

My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, As I by friends am well advertised, Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate, Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother, With many more confederates are in arms.

Such proclamation hath been made, my lord.
 
Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset, 'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms. But this good comfort bring I to your Highness: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest. Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat Unto the shore to ask those on the banks If they were his assistants, yea or no- Who answered him they came from Buckingham Upon his party. He, mistrusting them, Hoisted sail and made his course for Brittany.
 
March on, march on, since we are up in arms, If not to fight with foreign enemies, Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

Why, then All Souls' Day is my body's doomsday. This is the day which, in King Edward's time, I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife's allies. This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted. This, this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs.

The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines, Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough In your embowelled bosoms-this foul swine Is now even in the center of this isle, Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn. From Tamworth thither is but one day's march. In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends, To reap the harvest of perpetual peace By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
 
Every man's conscience is a thousand men, To fight against this guilty homicide.

He hath no friends but who are friends for fear. Which in his dearest need will fly from him.

But on thy side I may not be too forward, Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, Be executed in his father's sight. Farewell.

God and our good cause fight upon our side. The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces. Richard except, those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow. For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen, A bloody tyrant and a homicide; One raised in blood, and one in blood established; One that made means to come by what he hath, And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; A base foul stone, made precious by the foil Of England's chair, where he is falsely set; One that hath ever been God's enemy. Then if you fight against God's enemy, God will, in justice, ward you as his soldiers. If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain. If you do fight against your country's foes, Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire. If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors. If you do free your children from the sword, Your children's children quits it in your age. Then, in the name of God and all these rights, Advance your standards. Draw your willing swords. For me, the ransom of my bold attempt Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face; But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt The least of you shall share his part thereof. Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully; God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

Remember whom you are to cope withal, A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways, A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants, Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth To desperate ventures and assured destruction. You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest; You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives, They would restrain the one, distain the other. And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow, Long kept in Brittany at our mother's cost, A milksop, one that never in his life Felt so much cold as overshoes in snow? Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again, Lash hence these overweening rags of France, These famished beggars weary of their lives, Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit, For want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves. If we be conquered, let men conquer us, And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and thumped, And in record, left them the heirs of shame. Shall these enjoy our lands, lie with our wives, Ravish our daughters?

In the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his head and cut the winds, Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
 
Oh, where is Romeo? Saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
 
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun Peered forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad, Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursued my humor not pursuing his, And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
 
Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs. But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,

And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humor prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
 
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
 
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
 
Have you importuned him by any means?
 
Both by myself and many other friends. But he, his own affections' counselor, Is to himself-I will not say how true, But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm, Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the same. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow. We would as willingly give cure as know.
 
See, where he comes. So please you, step aside. I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
 
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift.-Come, madam, let's away.

Good morrow, cousin.
 
Is the day so young?
 
But new struck nine.
 
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
 
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
 
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
 
In love?
 
Out.
 
Of love?
 
Out of her favor, where I am in love.
 
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
 
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine?-O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate but more with love. Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first created! O heavy lightness, serious vanity, Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 22 --%%--
 
No, coz, I rather weep.
 
Good heart, at what?
 
At thy good heart's oppression.
 
Why, such is love's transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate, to have it pressed With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Farewell, my coz.
 
Soft! I will go along. And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
 
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here. This is not Romeo. He's some other where.
 
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
 
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
 
Groan! Why, no. But sadly, tell me who.

A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill. In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
 
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
 
A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
 
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
 
Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit. And, in strong proof of chastity well armed From love's weak childish bow, she lives uncharmed. She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. Oh, she is rich in beauty, only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
 
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
 
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
 
Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
 
O, teach me how I should forget to think!

'Tis the way To call hers exquisite, in question more. These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair. He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. Show me a mistress that is passing fair; What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who passed that passing fair? Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned in good time!

Indeed, I should have asked thee that before.
 
Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!
 
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither, and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
 
When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires, And these, who, often drowned, could never die, Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

Your mother.
 
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
 
This is the matter.-Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret.-Nurse, come back again. I have remembered me. Thou's hear our counsel. Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
 
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
 
She's not fourteen.
 
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-she is not fourteen. How long is it now to Lammastide?
 
A fortnight and odd days.

Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she-God rest all Christian souls!- Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God. She was too good for me. But, as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. That shall she. Marry, I remember it well. 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, And she was weaned-I never shall forget it- Of all the days of the year, upon that day. For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall. My lord and you were then at Mantua.- Nay, I do bear a brain.-But, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! "Shake!" quoth the dovehouse. 'Twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge. And since that time it is eleven years, For then she could stand alone. Nay, by the rood, She could have run and waddled all about, For even the day before, she broke her brow. And then my husband-God be with his soul! He was a merry man-took up the child. "Yea," quoth he, "Dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit, Wilt thou not, Jule?" and, by my holy dame, The pretty wretch left crying and said "ay." To see now, how a jest shall come about! I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it. "Wilt thou not, Jule?" quoth he. And, pretty fool, it stinted and said "ay."
 
Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone, A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly. "Yea," quoth my husband, "Fall'st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age. Wilt thou not, Jule?" It stinted and said "ay."
 
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
 
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed. An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
 
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
 
It is an honor that I dream not of.
 
An honor! Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat.
 
Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you Here in Verona, ladies of esteem Are made already mothers. By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

What say you? Can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast. Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen. Examine every married lineament And see how one another lends content, And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margin of his eyes. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him only lacks a cover. The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide. That book in many's eyes doth share the glory That in gold clasps locks in the golden story. So shall you share all that he doth possess By having him, making yourself no less.
 
No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound.

In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
 
Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
 
Queen Mab, what's she
 
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomi Over men's noses as they lie asleep. Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs, The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, Her traces of the smallest spider's web, Her collars of the moonshine's watery beams, Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 54 --%%--
 
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; On courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit. And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep, Then he dreams of another benefice. Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plaits the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage. This is she-
 
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
 
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being angered, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear. And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere. But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down. That were some spite. My invocation Is fair and honest. In his mistress' name I conjure only but to raise up him.
 
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, To be consorted with the humorous night. Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
 
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.- O Romeo, that she were! Oh, that she were An open arse, and thou a poperin pear. Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle bed. This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.- Come, shall we go?
 
Go, then, for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found.

But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she. Be not her maid since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off! It is my lady. Oh, it is my love. Oh, that she knew she were! She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? Her eye discourses. I will answer it.- I am too bold. 'Tis not to me she speaks. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek!

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
 
<i>(aside)</i> Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
 
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee Take all myself.
 
I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized. Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
 
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?

By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word.
 
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound. Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
 
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
 
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
 
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
 
If they do see thee they will murder thee.
 
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.
 
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
 
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
 
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire. He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot. Yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise.
 
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form. Fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "ay," And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swear'st Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries, They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light. But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more coying to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware, My true love's passion. Therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light love, Which the dark night hath so discovered.

Do not swear at all. Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
 
If my heart's dear love-
 
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden, Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say "It lightens." Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
 
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
 
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
 
Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
 
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.
 
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 88 --%%--
 
But to be frank, and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep. The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite.
 
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.- Anon, good Nurse!-Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little. I will come again.
 
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
 
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honorable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow By one that I'll procure to come to thee Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Hist! Romeo, hist!-Oh, for a falconer's voice, To lure this tassel-gentle back again! Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of "My Romeo!"

Let me stand here till thou remember it.
 
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Remembering how I love thy company.
 
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.
 
'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone. And yet no further than a wanton's bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.
 
I would I were thy bird.

The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels. Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb. What is her burying, grave that is her womb. And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some and yet all different. Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities. For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give. Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified.
 
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power. For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart. Two such opposed kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs-grace and rude will.

And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
 
Good morrow, Father.
 
Benedicite. What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie. But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature. Or if not so, then here I hit it right: Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
 
That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.
 
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
 
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father? No. I have forgot that name and that name's woe.
 
That's my good son. But where hast thou been, then?
 
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again. I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, That's by me wounded. Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies. I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.

Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
 
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage. When and where and how We met, we wooed and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray: That thou consent to marry us today.
 
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! How much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste! The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears. Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet. If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline. And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence then: Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
 
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
 
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
 
And badest me bury love.

Oh, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. But come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be, For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households' rancor to pure love.

Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
 
Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
 
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
 
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
 
A challenge, on my life.
 
Romeo will answer it.
 
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
 
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
 
Alas, poor Romeo! He is already dead, stabbed with a white wench's black eye, shot through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt shaft. And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
 
Why, what is Tybalt?
 
More than Prince of Cats. Oh, he's the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion. He rests his minim rests-one, two, and the third in your bosom. The very butcher of a silk button, a duelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause.

The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse. In half an hour she promised to return. Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so. Oh, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills. Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw love And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come. Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball. My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me.

So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
 
Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight. Do thou but close our hands with holy words, Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
 
These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite. Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so. Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire. The day is hot; the Capulets, abroad; And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl, For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
 
Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee!" and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.
 
Am I like such a fellow?
 
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
 
And what to?
 
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon? And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling!

An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
 
The fee simple? O simple!
 
By my head, here comes the Capulets.
 
By my heel, I care not.
 
Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Gentlemen, good e'en. A word with one of you.
 
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a blow.
 
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.
 
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
 
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 140 --%%--
 
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, "consort"!
 
We talk here in the public haunt of men. Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
 
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
 
Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
 
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery. Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower. Your worship in that sense may call him "man."
 
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain.
 
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting. Villain am I none. Therefore, farewell. I see thou know'st me not.
 
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 142 --%%--
 
I do protest I never injured thee, But love thee better than thou canst devise, Till thou shalt know the reason of my love. And so, good Capulet-which name I tender As dearly as my own-be satisfied.
 
O calm dishonourable, vile submission!  <i>Alla stoccata</i> carries it away. <i>(draws his sword)</i>  Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
 
What wouldst thou have with me?
 
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
 
I am for you. <i>(draws his sword)</i>
 
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
 
Come, sir, your <i>passado</i>.
 
<i>(draws his sword)</i> Draw, Benvolio. Beat down their weapons. Gentlemen, for shame! Forbear this outrage. Tybalt, Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath Forbidden bandying in Verona streets. Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

What, art thou hurt?
 
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough. Where is my page?-Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
 
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
 
No, 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.

This gentleman, the Prince's near ally, My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf. My reputation stained With Tybalt's slander.-Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor's steel!
 
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead! That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
 
This day's black fate on more days doth depend. This but begins the woe others must end.
 
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
 
Alive in triumph-and Mercutio slain! Away to heaven, respective lenity, And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now. Now, Tybalt, take the "villain" back again That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads, Staying for thine to keep him company. Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

Oh, I am fortune's fool!
 
Why dost thou stay?

Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
 
O noble prince, I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
 
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! O Prince! O cousin! Husband! Oh, the blood is spilled Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague. O cousin, cousin!
 
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
 
Tybalt here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay. Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethink How nice the quarrel was and urged withal Your high displeasure. All this uttered With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed, Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity, Retorts it. Romeo, he cries aloud, "Hold, friends! Friends, part!" and, swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points, And 'twixt them rushes-underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 152 --%%--
 
But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to 't they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain. And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
 
He is a kinsman to the Montague. Affection makes him false. He speaks not true. Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life. I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give. Romeo slew Tybalt. Romeo must not live.
 
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
 
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend. His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt.
 
And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence. I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding. My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding. But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine. I will be deaf to pleading and excuses. Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, Toward Phoebus' lodging. Such a wagoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west And bring in cloudy night immediately. Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen. Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties, or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, Think true love acted simple modesty. Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in night, For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back. Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun. Oh, I have bought the mansion of a love, But not possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them.

Oh, here comes my Nurse, And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.- Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?
 
Ay, ay, the cords.
 
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
 
Ah, welladay! He's dead, he's dead, he's dead! We are undone, lady, we are undone! Alack the day! He's gone, he's killed, he's dead!
 
Can heaven be so envious?
 
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo! Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
 
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus? This torture should be roared in dismal hell. Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but "ay," And that bare vowel <i>I</i> shall poison more Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. I am not I if there be such an <i>I,</i>  Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain, say "ay," or if not, "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
 
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes- God save the mark!-here on his manly breast. A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse. Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood, All in gore blood. I swooned at the sight.

O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! O courteous Tybalt! Honest gentleman! That ever I should live to see thee dead.
 
What storm is this that blows so contrary? Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead? My dearest cousin and my dearer lord? Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! For who is living if those two are gone?
 
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished. Romeo that killed him-he is banished.
 
O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
 
It did, it did. Alas the day, it did.
 
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face! Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? Beautiful tyrant! Fiend angelical! Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show, Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st. A damned saint, an honorable villain! O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh? Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound? Oh, that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace!

There's no trust, No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. Ah, where's my man?-Give me some aqua vitae.- These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. Shame come to Romeo!
 
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish! He was not born to shame. Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned. Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!
 
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
 
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I, thy three hours' wife, have mangled it? But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have killed my husband. Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring. Your tributary drops belong to woe, Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain, And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband. All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then? Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, That murdered me. I would forget it fain, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds. "Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished."

That "banished," that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death Was woe enough, if it had ended there. Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs, Why followed not, when she said "Tybalt's dead," "Thy father" or "thy mother," nay, or both, Which modern lamentations might have moved? But with a rearward following Tybalt's death, "Romeo is banished." To speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead. "Romeo is banished." There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that word's death. No words can that woe sound. Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
 
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse. Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
 
Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. Take up those cords.-Poor ropes, you are beguiled, Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled. He made you for a highway to my bed, But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. Come, cords.-Come, Nurse. I'll to my wedding bed. And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
 
A gentler judgment vanished from his lips: Not body's death, but body's banishment.
 
Ha, banishment! Be merciful, say "death," For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death. Do not say "banishment."
 
Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
 
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory, torture, hell itself. Hence "banished" is banished from the world, And world's exile is death. Then "banished,"

O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince, Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law, And turned that black word "death" to "banishment." This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
 
'Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here, Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog And little mouse, every unworthy thing, Live here in heaven and may look on her, But Romeo may not. More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips, Who even in pure and vestal modesty, Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin. But Romeo may not. He is banished. Flies may do this, but I from this must fly. They are free men, but I am banished. And sayst thou yet that exile is not death? Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But "banished" to kill me?-"Banished"! O Friar, the damned use that word in hell. Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend professed, To mangle me with that word "banished"?

Oh, then I see that madmen have no ears.
 
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
 
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
 
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel. Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

Wilt thou slay thyself, And slay thy lady that in thy life lives By doing damned hate upon thyself? Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose? Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, Digressing from the valor of a man; Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish; Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, Misshapen in the conduct of them both, Like powder in a skill-less soldier's flask, Is set afire by thine own ignorance; And thou dismembered with thine own defence. What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead- There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew'st Tybalt-there art thou happy.

<i>(aside)</i> Villain and he be many miles asunder.  <i>(to</i> LADY CAPULET<i>)</i> God pardon him! I do, with all my heart, And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
 
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
 
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
 
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company. And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
 
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him-dead- Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed. Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet. Oh, how my heart abhors To hear him named, and cannot come to him. To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him!
 
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
 
And joy comes well in such a needy time. What are they, beseech your ladyship?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 196 --%%--
 
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child. One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect'st not, nor I looked not for.
 
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
 
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
 
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride. I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo. I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet. And when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
 
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.
 
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, But for the sunset of my brother's son It rains downright. How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears, Evermore showering? In one little body Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind, For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears. The bark thy body is, Sailing in this salt flood. The winds thy sighs, Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, Without a sudden calm will overset Thy tempest-tossed body.-How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 198 --%%--
 
Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave!
 
Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife. How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
 
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate, But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
 
How, how, how, how? Chopped logic! What is this? "Proud," and "I thank you," and "I thank you not," And yet "not proud"? Mistress minion you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. Out, you green sickness, carrion! Out, you baggage! You tallow face!
 
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?
 
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch! I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, Or never after look me in the face. Speak not. Reply not. Do not answer me. My fingers itch.-Wife, we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child, But now I see this one is one too much And that we have a curse in having her. Out on her, hilding!
 
God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
 
And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue, Good prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go.
 
I speak no treason.
 
Oh, God 'i' good e'en.
 
May not one speak?
 
Peace, you mumbling fool! Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, For here we need it not.
 
You are too hot.
 
God's bread! It makes me mad. Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched. And having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage, Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly trained, Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts, Proportioned as one's thought would wish a man- And then to have a wretched puling fool, A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, To answer "I'll not wed," "I cannot love," "I am too young," "I pray you, pardon me."- But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you. Graze where you will, you shall not house with me. Look to 't, think on 't, I do not use to jest. Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart, advise. An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend. An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good. Trust to 't, bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.

Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
 
O God!-O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven. How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?

Faith, here it is. Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you. Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the county. Oh, he's a lovely gentleman. Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first. Or if it did not, Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.
 
Speakest thou from thy heart?
 
And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.
 
Amen!

Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved.
 
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.

On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
 
My father Capulet will have it so, And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
 
You say you do not know the lady's mind. Uneven is the course. I like it not.
 
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, And therefore have I little talked of love, For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears- Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste.
 
<i>(aside)</i> I would I knew not why it should be slowed.- Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
 
Happily met, my lady and my wife.
 
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

That "may be" must be, love, on Thursday next.

That's a certain text.
 
Come you to make confession to this Father?
 
To answer that, I should confess to you.
 
Do not deny to him that you love me.
 
I will confess to you that I love him.
 
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
 
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
 
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
 
The tears have got small victory by that, For it was bad enough before their spite.
 
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
 
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
 
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
 
It may be so, for it is not mine own.- Are you at leisure, holy Father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.- My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
 
God shield I should disturb devotion!- Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.  <i>(kisses her)</i> Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.
 
O, shut the door! And when thou hast done so, Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help.
 
O Juliet, I already know thy grief. It strains me past the compass of my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.
 
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I'll help it presently.  <i>(shows him a knife)</i>  God joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands. And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo sealed, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore out of thy long-experienced time, Give me some present counsel, or, behold, 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honor bring. Be not so long to speak. I long to die If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That copest with death himself to 'scape from it. An if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
 
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower; Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; Or bid me go into a new-made grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud- Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble- And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.
 
Hold, then. Go home, be merry. Give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow. Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone. Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.  <i>(shows her a vial)</i>  Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humor, for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest. The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part, deprived of supple government, Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death. And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then, as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes uncovered on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear, Abate thy valor in the acting it.

Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
 
<i>(gives her a vial)</i>  Hold. Get you gone. Be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.
 
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear Father.

There's a fearful point. Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? Or, if I live, is it not very like The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place- As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where for these many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed; Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort-?

I do remember an apothecary- And hereabouts he dwells-which late I noted In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples. Meager were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones, And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuffed, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scattered to make up a show.

Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them.
 
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear'st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks. Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes. Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back. The world is not thy friend nor the world's law. The world affords no law to make thee rich. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.  <i>(holds out money)</i>

Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!
 
This same should be the voice of Friar John. Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
 
Going to find a barefoot brother out, One of our order, to associate me, Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth. So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.
 
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
 
I could not send it-here it is again-  <i>(gives</i> FRIAR LAWRENCE <i>a letter)</i>  Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection.
 
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood, The letter was not nice but full of charge, Of dear import, and the neglecting it May do much danger. Friar John, go hence. Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 258 --%%--
 
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
 
Now must I to the monument alone. Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake. She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents. But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come. Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof. Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. Under yon yew trees lay thee all along, Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground- So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear'st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
 
(<i>aside</i>) I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.
 
<i>(scatters flowers at</i> JULIET'S <i>closed tomb)</i>  Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew- O woe! Thy canopy is dust and stones- Which with sweet water nightly I will dew. Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans, The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

Therefore hence, be gone. But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I farther shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage, wild, More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury. O, be gone! By heaven, I love thee better than myself, For I come hither armed against myself. Stay not, be gone.

I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so?-O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune's book. I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.

Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there.- Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favor can I do to thee, Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin.-Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous, And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that, I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again. Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids. Oh, here Will I set up my everlasting rest, And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace.

Who is it?
 
Romeo.

Full half an hour.

As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.

And steeped in blood?-Ah, what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
 
O comfortable Friar! Where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
 
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.-
 
What's here? A cup, closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.- O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.  <i>(kisses</i> ROMEO<i>)</i>  Thy lips are warm.

Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger, This is thy sheath. There rust and let me die.  <i>(stabs herself with</i> ROMEO<i>'s dagger and dies)</i>
 
This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
 
The ground is bloody.-Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you. Whoe'er you find, attach.
 
Pitiful sight! Here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried.- Go, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues. Some others search.

Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
 
Here is a friar that trembles, sighs and weeps. We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side.
 
A great suspicion. Stay the friar too.
 
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest?
 
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
 
Oh, the people in the street cry "Romeo," Some "Juliet," and some "Paris," and all run With open outcry toward our monument.

What fear is this which startles in our ears?
 
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new killed.
 
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
 
Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs.
 
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista'en-for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.
 
O me! This sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
 
Come, Montague, for thou art early up To see thy son and heir now early down.
 
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age?
 
Look, and thou shalt see.

Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.- Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
 
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge, Myself condemned and myself excused.
 
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
 
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife. I married them, and their stol'n marriage day Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city- For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betrothed and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 282 --%%--
 
Meantime I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stayed by accident, and yesternight Returned my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo, But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awakening, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes, and I entreated her come forth, And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know, and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if aught in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrificed some hour before his time Unto the rigor of severest law.
 
We still have known thee for a holy man.- Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
 
I brought my master news of Juliet's death, And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument.  <i>(shows a letter)</i> This letter he early bid me give his father, And threatened me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not and left him there.

Give me the letter. I will look on it.  <i>(takes letter from</i> BALTHASAR<i>)</i>  Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?- Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
 
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch.
 
<i>(skims the letter)</i> This letter doth make good the friar's words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies?-Capulet! Montague! See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords, too Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.
 
O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter's jointure, for no more Can I demand.
 
But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet.
 
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity.

Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord. He cried upon it at the merest loss, And twice today picked out the dullest scent. Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet. Procure me music ready when he wakes, To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound. And if he chance to speak, be ready straight And with a low submissive reverence Say, "What is it your Honor will command?" Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water and bestrewed with flowers, Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, And say, "Will 't please your Lordship cool your hands?" Someone be ready with a costly suit And ask him what apparel he will wear. Another tell him of his hounds and horse, And that his lady mourns at his disease. Persuade him that he hath been lunatic, And when he says he is, say that he dreams, For he is nothing but a mighty lord. This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs. It will be pastime passing excellent If it be husbanded with modesty.

For I tell you, sirs, If you should smile, he grows impatient.
 
Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves Were he the veriest antic in the world.
 
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one. Let them want nothing that my house affords.
 
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew, my page, And see him dressed in all suits like a lady. That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber And call him "madam," do him obeisance.

And if the boy have not a woman's gift To rain a shower of commanded tears, An onion will do well for such a shift, Which in a napkin being close conveyed Shall in despite enforce a watery eye. See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst: Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
 
I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman. I long to hear him call the drunkard "husband," And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant. I'll in to counsel them. Haply my presence May well abate the over-merry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

Tranio, since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua, nursery of arts, I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy, The pleasant garden of great Italy, And by my father's love and leave am armed With his goodwill and thy good company. My trusty servant, well approved in all, Here let us breathe and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies. Pisa, renowned for grave citizens, Gave me my being and my father first, A merchant of great traffic through the world, Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii. Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence, It shall become to serve all hopes conceived To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds. And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study Virtue, and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achieved. Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come, as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

<i>Mi perdonato,</i> gentle master mine. I am in all affected as yourself, Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. Only, good master, while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline, Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray, Or so devote to Aristotle's checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured. Balk logic with acquaintance that you have, And practice rhetoric in your common talk; Music and poesy use to quicken you; The mathematics and the metaphysics- Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you. No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en. In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
 
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise. If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore, We could at once put us in readiness And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget. But stay awhile. What company is this?
 
Master, some show to welcome us to town.
 
Gentlemen, importune me no farther, For how I firmly am resolved you know- That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder. If either of you both love Katherina, Because I know you well and love you well Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 32 --%%--
 
To cart her, rather. She's too rough for me.- There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
 
<i>(to</i> BAPTISTA<i>)</i> I pray you, sir, is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
 
"Mates," maid? how mean you that? No mates for you Unless you were of gentler, milder mold.
 
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear. I wis it is not halfway to her heart. But if it were, doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool.
 
From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!
 
And me too, good Lord!
 
<i>(aside to</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  Husht, master, here's some good pastime toward. That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

<i>(aside to</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Well said, master. Mum, and gaze your fill.
 
<i>(to</i> GREMIO <i>and</i> HORTENSIO<i>)</i>  Gentlemen, that I may soon make good What I have said-Bianca, get you in, And let it not displease thee, good Bianca, For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
 
A pretty peat! It is best Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
 
Sister, content you in my discontent.- Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe. My books and instruments shall be my company, On them to look and practice by myself.
 
Hark, Tranio! Thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
 
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange? Sorry am I that our goodwill effects Bianca's grief.
 
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
 
Gentlemen, content ye. I am resolved.- Go in, Bianca.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 36 --%%--
 
And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, Or, Signior Gremio, you know any such, Prefer them hither, for to cunning men I will be very kind, and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up. And so farewell.-Katherina, you may stay, For I have more to commune with Bianca.
 
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
 
You may go to the devil's dam! Your gifts are so good here's none will hold you.-Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out. Our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell. Yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.
 
So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love, to labor and effect one thing specially.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 38 --%%--
 
What's that, I pray?
 
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
 
A husband? A devil!
 
I say a husband.
 
I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
 
Tush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.
 
I cannot tell. But I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross every morning.
 
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to 't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?
 
I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 40 --%%--
 
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold?
 
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely. But see, while idly I stood looking on, I found the effect of love in idleness And now in plainness do confess to thee That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was, Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio, If I achieve not this young modest girl. Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst. Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
 
Master, it is no time to chide you now. Affection is not rated from the heart. If love have touched you, naught remains but so:  <i>Redime te captum quam queas minimo.</i>
 
Gramercies, lad, go forward. This contents. The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
 
Master, you looked so longly on the maid, Perhaps you marked not what's the pith of all.
 
Oh yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 42 --%%--
 
Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
 
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air. Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
 
<i>(aside)</i> Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.- I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid, Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands: Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd That till the father rid his hands of her, Master, your love must live a maid at home, And therefore has he closely mewed her up, Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.
 
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he! But art thou not advised, he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
 
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted!
 
I have it, Tranio!
 
Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
 
Tell me thine first.
 
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid: That's your device.
 
It is. May it be done?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 44 --%%--
 
Not possible. For who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio's son, Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends, Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
 
<i>Basta,</i> content thee, for I have it full. We have not yet been seen in any house, Nor can we be distinguished by our faces For man or master. Then it follows thus: Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, Keep house and port and servants as I should. I will some other be, some Florentine, Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa. 'Tis hatched, and shall be so. Tranio, at once Uncase thee. Take my colored hat and cloak.
 
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee, But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
 
Where have I been? Nay, how now, where are you? Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or you stolen his? Or both? Pray, what's the news?
 
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest, And therefore frame your manners to the time. Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life, Puts my apparel and my countenance on, And I for my escape have put on his; For in a quarrel since I came ashore I killed a man and fear I was descried. Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, While I make way from hence to save my life. You understand me?
 
Aye, sir. <i>(aside)</i> Ne'er a whit.
 
And not a jot of "Tranio" in your mouth. Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
 
The better for him. Would I were so too.
 
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter. But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies. When I am alone, why then I am Tranio; But in all places else, your master Lucentio.

Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely. Comes there any more of it?

Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua, but of all My best beloved and approved friend, Hortensio. And I trow this is his house. Here, sirrah Grumio. Knock, I say.
 
Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your Worship?
 
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
 
Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?
 
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
 
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first, And then I know after who comes by the worst.
 
Will it not be? Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it. I'll try how you can <i>sol, fa,</i> and sing it.
 
Help, mistress, help! My master is mad.

How now, what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio? How do you all at Verona?
 
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?  <i>Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,</i> may I say.
 
Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.-Rise, Grumio, rise. We will compound this quarrel.
 
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service-look you, sir: he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out? Whom, would to God, I had well knocked at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
 
A senseless villain, good Hortensio. I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it.
 
Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: "Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly"? And come you now with "knocking at the gate"?
 
Sirrah, begone or talk not, I advise you.

Petruchio, patience. I am Grumio's pledge. Why, this' a heavy chance 'twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio. And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
 
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home, Where small experience grows. But in a few, Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me: Antonio, my father, is deceased, And I have thrust myself into this maze, Happily to wive and thrive as best I may. Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world.
 
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd, ill-favored wife? Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich. But thou'rt too much my friend, And I'll not wish thee to her.
 
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we Few words suffice. And therefore, if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife, As wealth is burden of my wooing dance, Be she as foul as was Florentius' love, As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse, She moves me not, or not removes at least Affection's edge in me, were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas. I come to wive it wealthily in Padua; If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 56 --%%--
 
<i>(to</i> HORTENSIO<i>)</i> Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.
 
Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in, I will continue that I broached in jest. I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife With wealth enough, and young and beauteous, Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman. Her only fault, and that is faults enough, Is that she is intolerable curst, And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure That, were my state far worser than it is, I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
 
Hortensio, peace. Thou know'st not gold's effect. Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough; For I will board her, though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
 
Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman. Her name is Katherina Minola, Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.
 
I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceased father well. I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 58 --%%--
 
<i>(to</i> HORTENSIO<i>)</i> I pray you, sir, let him go while the humor lasts. O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in his rope tricks. I'll tell you what sir: an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
 
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista's keep my treasure is. He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love, Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehearsed, That ever Katherina will be wooed. Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en, That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
 
"Katherine the curst!" A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
 
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca, That so I may, by this device at least, Have leave and leisure to make love to her And, unsuspected, court her by herself.

And let me have them very well perfum'd For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
 
<i>(as</i> CAMBIO<i>)</i> Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you As for my patron, stand you so assured, As firmly as yourself were still in place, Yea, and perhaps with more successful words Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

I promised to enquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca, And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man, for learning and behavior Fit for her turn, well read in poetry And other books-good ones, I warrant ye.
 
'Tis well. And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress. So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
 
Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.

So said, so done, is well. Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
 
I know she is an irksome brawling scold. If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
 
No? Say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
 
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son. My father dead, my fortune lives for me. And I do hope good days and long to see.
 
O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange! But if you have a stomach, to 't, i' God's name: You shall have me assisting you in all. But will you woo this wildcat?
 
Will I live?
 
Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
 
Why came I hither but to that intent? Think you a little din can daunt mine ears? Have I not in my time heard lions roar? Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds, Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat? Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?

For he fears none.
 
Hortensio, hark. This gentleman is happily arrived, My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
 
I promised we would be contributors And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
 
And so we will, provided that he win her.
 
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, That being a stranger in this city here Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous. Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, In the preferment of the eldest sister. This liberty is all that I request, That, upon knowledge of my parentage, I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo And free access and favor as the rest. And toward the education of your daughters, I here bestow a simple instrument And this small packet of Greek and Latin books. BIONDELLO <i>brings the gifts forward</i>  If you accept them, then their worth is great.
 
Lucentio is your name. Of whence, I pray?
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.
 
A mighty man of Pisa. By report I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.  <i>(to</i> HORTENSIO <i>as</i> LITIO<i>)</i> Take you the lute,  <i>(to</i> LUCENTIO <i>as</i> CAMBIO<i>)</i> and you the set of books. You shall go see your pupils presently. Holla, within!

Sirrah, lead these gentlemen To my daughters, and tell them both These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
 
We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner. You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
 
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo. You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreased. Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
 
After my death, the one half of my lands, And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
 
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, In all my lands and leases whatsoever. Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.
 
Ay, when the special thing is well obtained, That is, her love, for that is all in all.
 
Why, that is nothing. For I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury. Though little fire grows great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all. So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 86 --%%--
 
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed. But be thou armed for some unhappy words.
 
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds, That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.
 
How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?
 
<i>(as</i> LITIO<i>)</i> For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
 
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
 
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier. Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
 
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
 
Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me. I did but tell her she mistook her frets, And bowed her hand to teach her fingering, When, with a most impatient devilish spirit, "'Frets' call you these?" quoth she. "I'll fume with them!" And with that word she struck me on the head, And through the instrument my pate made way,
 
--%%-- pageNum: 88 --%%--
 
And there I stood amazed for a while As on a pillory, looking through the lute, While she did call me "rascal fiddler" And "twangling Jack"; with twenty such vile terms, As had she studied to misuse me so.
 
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench. I love her ten times more than e'er I did. Oh, how I long to have some chat with her!
 
(to HORTENSIO as LITIO) Well, go with me and be not so discomfited. Proceed in practice with my younger daughter. She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns. Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
 
I pray you do.
 
I'll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes. Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale. Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew. Say she be mute and will not speak a word; Then I'll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence. If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks, As though she bid me stay by her a week. If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married. But here she comes-and now, Petruchio, speak.

Good morrow, Kate-for that's your name, I hear.
 
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing. They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
 
You lie, in faith, for you are called plain Kate, And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst, But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom, Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate- For dainties are all Kates-and therefore, Kate, Take this of me, Kate of my consolation: Hearing thy mildness praised in every town, Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded- Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs- Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
 
"Moved," in good time. Let him that moved you hither Remove you hence. I knew you at the first You were a moveable.
 
Why, what's a moveable?
 
A joint stool.
 
Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
 
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
 
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

No such jade as you, if me you mean.
 
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee, For knowing thee to be but young and light-
 
Too light for such a swain as you to catch, And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
 
"Should be"-should buzz!
 
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
 
O slow-winged turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
 
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
 
Come, come, you wasp. I' faith, you are too angry.
 
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
 
My remedy is then to pluck it out.
 
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
 
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
 
In his tongue.
 
Whose tongue?
 
Yours, if you talk of tales. And so farewell.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 94 --%%--
 
What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again, Good Kate. I am a gentleman.
 
That I'll try.
 
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again.
 
So may you lose your arms. If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
 
A herald, Kate? Oh, put me in thy books!
 
What is your crest? A coxcomb?
 
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
 
No cock of mine. You crow too like a craven.
 
Nay, come, Kate, come. You must not look so sour.
 
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
 
Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.
 
There is, there is.

Then show it me.
 
Had I a glass, I would.
 
What, you mean my face?
 
Well aimed of such a young one.
 
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
 
Yet you are withered.
 
'Tis with cares.
 
I care not.
 
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you 'scape not so.
 
I chafe you, if I tarry. Let me go.
 
No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle. 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, And now I find report a very liar. For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers. Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk. But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, With gentle conference, soft and affable. Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 98 --%%--
 
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts, and sweeter than the kernels. Oh, let me see thee walk! Thou dost not halt.
 
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
 
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait? Oh, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate, And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful.
 
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
 
It is extempore, from my mother wit.
 
A witty mother! Witless else her son.
 
Am I not wise?
 
Yes, keep you warm.
 
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed. And therefore, setting all this chat aside, Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented That you shall be my wife, your dowry 'greed on, And, will you, nill you, I will marry you. Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn, For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty, Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well, Thou must be married to no man but me. For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates.

Here comes your father. Never make denial. I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
 
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
 
How but well, sir? How but well? It were impossible I should speed amiss.
 
Why, how now, daughter Katherine? In your dumps?
 
Call you me daughter? Now, I promise you You have showed a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic, A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack, That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
 
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her. If she be curst, it is for policy, For she's not froward, but modest as the dove. She is not hot, but temperate as the morn. For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity. And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together, That upon Sunday is the wedding day.
 
I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
 
Hark, Petruchio: she says she'll see thee hanged first.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 102 --%%--
 
Is this your speeding? Nay, then, good night our part.
 
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself. If she and I be pleased, what's that to you? 'Tis bargained 'twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company. I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me. O, the kindest Kate! She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love. O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.- Give me thy hand, Kate. I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day. Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests. I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
 
I know not what to say, but give me your hands. God send you joy, Petruchio. 'Tis a match.
 
Amen, say we. We will be witnesses.
 
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu. I will to Venice. Sunday comes apace. We will have rings, and things, and fine array, And kiss me, Kate. We will be married o' Sunday.
 
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?
 
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part, And venture madly on a desperate mart.

<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you. 'Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.
 
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
 
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch. But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter. Now is the day we long have looked for. I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
 
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
 
But thine doth fry. Skipper, stand back. 'Tis age that nourisheth.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
 
Content you, gentlemen. I will compound this strife. 'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca's love. Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 106 --%%--
 
First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold, Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry, In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns, In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework, Pewter and brass, and all things that belong To house or housekeeping. Then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion. Myself am struck in years, I must confess, And if I die tomorrow this is hers, If whilst I live she will be only mine.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  That "only" came well in. <i>(to</i> BAPTISTA<i>)</i> Sir, list to me: I am my father's heir and only son. If I may have your daughter to my wife, I'll leave her houses three or four as good, Within rich Pisa walls, as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua, Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.- What, have I pinched you, Signior Gremio?
 
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!  <i>(aside)</i> My land amounts not to so much in all.- That she shall have, besides an argosy That now is lying in Marcellus' road.  <i>(to</i> TRANIO<i>)</i> What, have I choked you with an argosy?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 108 --%%--
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses, And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her, And twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next.
 
Nay, I have offered all, I have no more, And she can have no more than all I have.  <i>(to</i> BAPTISTA<i>)</i> If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  Why, then the maid is mine from all the world, By your firm promise. Gremio is outvied.
 
I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me. If you should die before him, where's her dower?
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
 
And may not young men die as well as old?
 
Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved: On Sunday next, you know My daughter Katherina is to be married.  <i>(to</i> TRANIO <i>as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca Be bride to you, if you make this assurance. If not, to Signior Gremio. And so I take my leave, and thank you both.

Adieu, good neighbor.
 
Now I fear thee not. Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy! An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
 
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide! Yet I have faced it with a card of ten. 'Tis in my head to do my master good. I see no reason but supposed Lucentio Must get a father, called "supposed Vincentio"- And that's a wonder. Fathers commonly Do get their children. But in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong To strive for that which resteth in my choice. I am no breeching scholar in the schools. I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times But learn my lessons as I please myself. And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down.

Mistrust it not, for sure Aeacides Was Ajax, called so from his grandfather.

Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
 
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

<i>(to</i> TRANIO<i>)</i> Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married, And yet we hear not of our son-in-law. What will be said? What mockery will it be, To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage? What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
 
No shame but mine. I must, forsooth, be forced To give my hand, opposed against my heart, Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen, Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure. I told you, I, he was a frantic fool, Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior, And, to be noted for a merry man, He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage, Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns, Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed. Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say, "Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife, If it would please him come and marry her!"
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too. Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, Whatever fortune stays him from his word: Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 124 --%%--
 
Would Katherine had never seen him, though!
 
Go, girl. I cannot blame thee now to weep, For such an injury would vex a very saint, Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.
 
Master, master! News, old news, and such news as you never heard of!
 
Is it new and old too? How may that be?
 
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?
 
Is he come?
 
Why, no, sir.
 
What then?
 
He is coming.
 
When will he be here?
 
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> But say, what to thine old news?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 126 --%%--
 
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair of boots that have been candle cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armory, with a broken hilt and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipped, with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred, besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legged before and with a half-checked bit and a headstall of sheeps leather, which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repaired with knots, one girth six times pieced, and a woman's crupper of velour, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
 
Who comes with him?
 
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat and the humor of forty fancies pricked in 't for a feather. A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  'Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion, Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-appareled.
 
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 128 --%%--
 
Why, sir, he comes not.
 
Didst thou not say he comes?
 
Who? That Petruchio came?
 
Ay, that Petruchio came.
 
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
 
Why, that's all one.
 
Nay, by Saint Jamy, I hold you a penny, A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many.
 
Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
 
You are welcome, sir.
 
And yet I come not well.
 
And yet you halt not.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Not so well appareled as I wish you were.

Were it better I should rush in thus- But where is Kate? Where is my love? How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown. And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument, Some comet or unusual prodigy?
 
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day. First were we sad, fearing you would not come, Now sadder that you come so unprovided. Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate, An eyesore to our solemn festival.
 
And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detained you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourself.
 
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear. Sufficeth I am come to keep my word, Though in some part enforced to digress, Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal. But where is Kate? I stay too long from her. The morning wears. 'Tis time we were at church.
 
See not your bride in these unreverent robes. Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
 
Not I, believe me. Thus I'll visit her.
 
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 132 --%%--
 
Good sooth, even thus. Therefore, ha' done with words: To me she's married, not unto my clothes. Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements, 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself. But what a fool am I to chat with you, When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
 
He hath some meaning in his mad attire. We will persuade him, be it possible, To put on better ere he go to church.
 
I'll after him, and see the event of this.
 
But sir, to love concerneth us to add Her father's liking, which to bring to pass, As I before unparted to your worship, I am to get a man-whate'er he be It skills not much, we'll fit him to our turn- And he shall be "Vincentio of Pisa" And make assurance here in Padua Of greater sums than I have promised. So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly, 'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage, Which, once performed, let all the world say no, I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
 
That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business. We'll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
 
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
 
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
 
A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed, A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
 
Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him! I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife, "Ay, by gogs wouns!" quoth he, and swore so loud That, all amazed, the priest let fall the book, And as he stooped again to take it up, The mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book, and book and priest. "Now take them up," quoth he, "if any list."
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> What said the wench when he rose again?
 
Trembled and shook, for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him. But after many ceremonies done, He calls for wine. "A health!" quoth he, as if He had been aboard, carousing to his mates After a storm; quaffed off the muscatel And threw the sops all in the sexton's face, Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking. This done, he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo. And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame, And after me, I know, the rout is coming. Such a mad marriage never was before.
 
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for you I know you think to dine with me today And have prepared great store of wedding cheer, But so it is, my haste doth call me hence, And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
 
Is 't possible you will away tonight?
 
I must away today, before night come. Make it no wonder. If you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay. And, honest company, I thank you all, That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife. Dine with my father, drink a health to me, For I must hence, and farewell to you all.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
 
It may not be.
 
Let me entreat you.
 
It cannot be.
 
Let me entreat you.
 
I am content.
 
Are you content to stay?

I am content you shall entreat me stay, But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
 
Now, if you love me, stay.
 
Grumio, my horse.
 
Ay, sir, they be ready. The oats have eaten the horses.
 
Nay, then, Do what thou canst, I will not go today, No, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself. The door is open, sir. There lies your way. You may be jogging whiles your boots are green. For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself. 'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom, That take it on you at the first so roundly.
 
O Kate, content thee. Prithee, be not angry.
 
I will be angry. What hast thou to do?- Father, be quiet. He shall stay my leisure.
 
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
 
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner. I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist.
 
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.- Obey the bride, you that attend on her. Go to the feast, revel and domineer, Carouse full measure to her maidenhead, Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves. But for my bonny Kate, she must with me. Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret; I will be master of what is mine own. She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house, My household stuff, my field, my barn, My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything. And here she stands, touch her whoever dare. I'll bring mine action on the proudest he That stops my way in Padua.-Grumio, Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves. Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man.- Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate. I'll buckler thee against a million.

Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so 'rayed? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself. For, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.-Holla, ho! Curtis!
 
Who is that calls so coldly?
 
A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis.
 
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
 
Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire. Cast on no water.
 
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 148 --%%--
 
She was, good Curtis, before this frost. But thou knowest winter tames man, woman and beast, for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself, fellow Curtis.
 
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
 
Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
 
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
 
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and therefore fire! Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
 
There's fire ready. And therefore, good Grumio, the news.
 
Why, "Jack, boy! Ho, boy!" and as much news as wilt thou.
 
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
 
Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold. Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the carpets laid, and everything in order?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 150 --%%--
 
All ready. And therefore, I pray thee, news.
 
First, know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen out.
 
How?
 
Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a tale.
 
Let's ha' 't, good Grumio.
 
Lend thine ear.
 
Here.
 
There!
 
This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
 
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale. And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress-
 
Both of one horse?
 
What's that to thee?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 152 --%%--
 
Why, a horse.
 
Tell thou the tale! But hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse. Thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed that never prayed before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.
 
By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
 
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
 
They are.
 
Call them forth.
 
<i>(calling offstage)</i> Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to countenance my mistress.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 154 --%%--
 
Why, she hath a face of her own.
 
Who knows not that?
 
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
 
I call them forth to credit her.
 
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
 
Welcome home, Grumio.
 
How now, Grumio?
 
What, Grumio!
 
Fellow Grumio!
 
How now, old lad?
 
Welcome, you!-How now, you?-What, you!-Fellow, you!-And thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
 
All things is ready. How near is our master?
 
E'en at hand, alighted by this. And therefore be not- Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.
 
You peasant swain! You whoreson malt-horse drudge! Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
 
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel. There was no link to color Peter's hat, And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing. There were none fine but Adam, Rafe, and Gregory. The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly. Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
 
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.

I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet. The meat was well, if you were so contented.
 
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away. And I expressly am forbid to touch it, For it engenders choler, planteth anger; And better 'twere that both of us did fast, Since of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh. Be patient, tomorrow 't shall be mended, And, for this night, we'll fast for company.

Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
 
Peter, didst ever see the like?
 
He kills her in her own humor.
 
Where is he?
 
In her chamber, Making a sermon of continency to her, And rails and swears and rates, that she, poor soul, Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, And sits as one new-risen from a dream. Away, away, for he is coming hither!
 
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And 'tis my hope to end successfully. My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure. Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come and know her keeper's call.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 164 --%%--
 
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient. She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat. Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not. As with the meat, some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed, And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets. Ay, and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her. And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night, And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl, And with the clamor keep her still awake. This is a way to kill a wife with kindness, And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor. He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.

What, master, read you? First resolve me that.

And may you prove, sir, master of your art.

Mistake no more. I am not Litio, Nor a musician as I seem to be, But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentlema And makes a god of such a cullion. Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Signior Hortensio, I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca, And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, I will with you, if you be so contented, Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
 
See how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio, Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more, but do forswear her As one unworthy all the former favors That I have fondly flattered her withal.
 
And here I take the like unfeigned oath Never to marry with her, though she would entreat. Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!
 
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow, Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard. And so farewell, Signior Lucentio. Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, Shall win my love, and so I take my leave, In resolution as I swore before.

Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case! Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love, And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

Mistress, we have.
 
Then we are rid of Litio.
 
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.
 
God give him joy!
 
Ay, and he'll tame her.
 
He says so, Tranio?
 
Faith, he is gone unto the taming school.
 
The taming school? What, is there such a place?
 
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master, That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

And what of him, Tranio?
 
If he be credulous and trust my tale, I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio And give assurance to Baptista Minola As if he were the right Vincentio. Take in your love, and then let me alone.
 
God save you, sir.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  And you, sir. You are welcome. Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

My life, sir! how, I pray? For that goes hard.
 
'Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? Your ships are stayed at Venice, and the Duke, For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him, Hath published and proclaimed it openly. 'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come, You might have heard it else proclaimed about.
 
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so, For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Well, sir, to do you courtesy, This will I do, and this I will advise you. First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
 
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

I know him not, but I have heard of him: A merchant of incomparable wealth.

<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> To save your life in this extremity, This favor will I do you for his sake- And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio- His name and credit shall you undertake, And in my house you shall be friendly lodged. Look that you take upon you as you should. You understand me, sir. So shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city. If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
 
O sir, I do, and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Then go with me to make the matter good. This, by the way, I let you understand: My father is here looked for every day To pass assurance of a dower in marriage 'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here. In all these circumstances I'll instruct you. Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
 
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears. What, did he marry me to famish me? Beggars that come unto my father's door Upon entreaty have a present alms. If not, elsewhere they meet with charity. But I, who never knew how to entreat, Nor never needed that I should entreat, Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed. And that which spites me more than all these wants, He does it under name of perfect love, As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death. I prithee, go and get me some repast, I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
 
What say you to a neat's foot?
 
'Tis passing good. I prithee let me have it.
 
I fear it is too choleric a meat. How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled?
 
I like it well. Good Grumio, fetch it me.
 
I cannot tell. I fear 'tis choleric. What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

Why then, the mustard without the beef.
 
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,  <i>Beats him</i>  That feed'st me with the very name of meat. Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you That triumph thus upon my misery. Go, get thee gone, I say.
 
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
 
Mistress, what cheer?
 
Faith, as cold as can be.
 
Pluck up thy spirits. Look cheerfully upon me. Here love, thou seest how diligent I am, To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee. I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks. What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof. Here, take away this dish.

And now, my honey love, Will we return unto thy father's house And revel it as bravely as the best, With silken coats and caps and golden rings, With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things, With scarves and fans and double change of brav'ry, With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry. What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.

Why, this was molded on a porringer! A velvet dish! Fie, fie, 'tis lewd and filthy! Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut shell, A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap. Away with it! Come, let me have a bigger.
 
I'll have no bigger. This doth fit the time, And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
 
When you are gentle, you shall have one too, And not till then.
 
<i>(aside)</i> That will not be in haste.
 
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak, And speak I will. I am no child, no babe. Your betters have endured me say my mind, And if you cannot, best you stop your ears. My tongue will tell the anger of my heart Or else my heart, concealing it, will break, And, rather than it shall, I will be free Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
 
Why, thou say'st true. It is a paltry cap, A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie. I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
 
Love me or love me not, I like the cap, And it I will have, or I will have none.
 
Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see 't. O mercy, God! What masking stuff is here? What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.

You bid me make it orderly and well, According to the fashion and the time.
 
Marry, and did. But if you be remembered, I did not bid you mar it to the time. Go, hop me over every kennel home, For you shall hop without my custom, sir. I'll none of it. Hence, make your best of it.
 
I never saw a better-fashioned gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable. Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
 
Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.
 
She says your Worship means to make a puppet of her.
 
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble, Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail! Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket thou! Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread? Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant, Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st! I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.

Your Worship is deceived. The gown is made Just as my master had direction. Grumio gave order how it should be done.
 
I gave him no order. I gave him the stuff.
 
But how did you desire it should be made?
 
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
 
But did you not request to have it cut?
 
Thou hast faced many things.
 
I have.
 
Face not me. Thou hast braved many men; brave not me. I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cutout the gown, but I did not bid him cut it to pieces. <i>Ergo,</i> thou liest.
 
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.

Ay, there's the villany.
 
Error i' the bill, sir, error i' the bill! I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again, and that I'll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
 
This is true that I say: an I had thee in place where, thou shouldst know it.
 
I am for thee straight. Take thou the bill, give me thy mete- yard, and spare not me.
 
God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
 
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

There will we mount, and thither walk on foot. Let's see, I think 'tis now some seven o'clock, And well we may come there by dinnertime.
 
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two, And 'twill be supper time ere you come there.
 
It shall be seven ere I go to horse. Look what I speak, or do, or think to do, You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone. I will not go today, and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

Ay, what else? and but I be deceived, Signior Baptista may remember me, Near twenty years ago, in Genoa, Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
 
I warrant you.
 
But, sir, here comes your boy. 'Twere good he were schooled.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Fear you not him.-Sirrah Biondello, Now do your duty throughly, I advise you. Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
 
Tut, fear not me.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
 
I told him that your father was at Venice, And that you looked for him this day in Padua.

<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Thou'rt a tall fellow. Hold thee that to drink.  <i>Gives money</i>
 
Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
 
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.- Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of. I pray you stand good father to me now. Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
 
<i>(as</i> VINCENTIO<i>)</i> Soft son.- Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself. And, for the good report I hear of you And for the love he beareth to your daughter And she to him, to stay him not too long, I am content, in a good father's care, To have him matched. And if you please to like No worse than I, upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestowed, For curious I cannot be with you, Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
 
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say. Your plainness and your shortness please me well. Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, Or both dissemble deeply their affections. And therefore, if you say no more than this, That like a father you will deal with him And pass my daughter a sufficient dower, The match is made, and all is done. Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 200 --%%--
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i>  I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part's agreement stand?
 
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants. Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still, And happily we might be interrupted.
 
<i>(as</i> LUCENTIO<i>)</i> Then at my lodging, an it like you. There doth my father lie, and there this night We'll pass the business privately and well. Send for your daughter by your servant here. My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. The worst is this, that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
 
It likes me well.-Cambio, hie you home, And bid Bianca make her ready straight. And, if you will, tell what hath happened: Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua, And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
 
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!

I follow you.
 
Cambio.
 
What sayest thou, Biondello?
 
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
 
Biondello, what of that?
 
Faith, nothing; but 'has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
 
I pray thee, moralize them.
 
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.
 
And what of him?
 
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
 
And then?
 
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours.
 
And what of all this?

I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance. Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. To th' church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses. If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.
 
Hear'st thou, Biondello?
 
I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir. And so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.
 
I may, and will, if she be so contented. She will be pleased. Then wherefore should I doubt? Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her. It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her.

Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad. This is a man-old, wrinkled, faded, withered- And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
 
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes That have been so bedazzled with the sun That everything I look on seemeth green. Now I perceive thou art a reverend father. Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
 
Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known Which way thou travellest. If along with us, We shall be joyful of thy company.
 
Fair sir, and you, my merry mistress, That with your strange encounter much amazed me, My name is called Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa, And bound I am to Padua, there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen.
 
What is his name?
 
Lucentio, gentle sir.
 
Happily met, the happier for thy son. And now by law as well as reverend age, I may entitle thee my loving father. The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not Nor be grieved. She is of good esteem, Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth. Beside, so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman.

Let me embrace with old Vincentio, And wander we to see thy honest son, Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
 
But is this true, or is it else your pleasure, Like pleasant travelers, to break a jest Upon the company you overtake?
 
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
 
Come, go along and see the truth hereof, For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
 
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart. Have to my widow, and if she be froward, Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

Nay, faith, I'll see the church a' your back, and then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
 
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
 
Sir, here's the door. This is Lucentio's house. My father's bears more toward the marketplace. Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
 
You shall not choose but drink before you go. I think I shall command your welcome here, And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

<i>(to</i> VINCENTIO<i>)</i> Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.-Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him.

What, is the man lunatic?

Thy father! O villain! He is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you think is his name?
 
His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
 
<i>(as</i> VINCENTIO<i>)</i> Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
 
Lucentio! Oh, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke's name. O my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

Carry this mad knave to the jail.-Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
 
Carry me to the jail?
 
Stay, officer. He shall not go to prison.
 
Talk not, Signior Gremio. I say he shall go to prison.
 
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business. I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.

Away with the dotard! To the jail with him!
 
Thus strangers may be haled and abused.-O monstrous villain!
 
O! We are spoiled and yonder he is! Deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.
 
Pardon, sweet father.
 
Lives my sweet son?
 
Pardon, dear father.
 
How hast thou offended? Where is Lucentio?
 
Here's Lucentio, right son to the right Vincentio, That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
 
Where is that damned villain, Tranio, That faced and braved me in this matter so?
 
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
 
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
 
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio, While he did bear my countenance in the town, And happily I have arrived at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss. What Tranio did, myself enforced him to. Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
 
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the jail.
 
But do you hear, sir, have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill?
 
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you. Go to. But I will in to be revenged for this villany.
 
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

A good swift simile, but something currish.
 
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself. 'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
 
Oh, Oh, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
 
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
 
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
 
He has a little galled me, I confess. And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
 
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
 
Well, I say no. And therefore, for assurance, Let's each one send unto his wife; And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her, Shall win the wager which we will propose.

Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
 
Fie! What a foolish duty call you this?
 
I would your duty were as foolish too. The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime.

Come, come, you're mocking. We will have no telling.

Fie, fie! Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor. It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, And in no sense is meet or amiable. A woman moved is like a fountain troubled, Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty, And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it. Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee, And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labor both by sea and land, To watch the night in storms, the day in cold, Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe, And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love, fair looks and true obedience- Too little payment for so great a debt. Such duty as the subject owes the prince, Even such a woman oweth to her husband. And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, And not obedient to his honest will, What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord? I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace; Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve, love, and obey. Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts? Come, come, you froward and unable worms!

Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, And place your hands below your husband's foot: In token of which duty, if he please, My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
 
Why, there's a wench! Come on and kiss me, Kate.
 
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha 't.
 
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
 
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek, Dashes the fire out. Oh, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces. Oh, the cry did knock Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished. Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her.
 
Be collected. No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart There's no harm done.
 
Oh, woe the day!
 
No harm. I have done nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my dear one-thee my daughter, who Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing Of whence I am, nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell And thy no greater father.
 
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.

So, Lie there, my art.-Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort. The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul- No, not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel- Which thou heard'st cry, which thou sawst sink. Sit down. For thou must now know farther.
 
You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition, Concluding, "Stay. Not yet."
 
The hour's now come. The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old.

But that I do not.
 
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power.
 
Sir, are not you my father?
 
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued.

My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio- I pray thee, mark me (that a brother should Be so perfidious!)-he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel. Those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle- Dost thou attend me?
 
Sir, most heedfully.
 
Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, who t' advance and who To trash for overtopping, new created The creatures that were mine, I say-or changed 'em, Or else new formed 'em-having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, And sucked my verdure out on 't. Thou attend'st not.

I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature. And my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie-he did believe He was indeed the duke, out o' th' substitution And executing th' outward face of royalty, With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing- Dost thou hear?
 
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
 
To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable, confederates- So dry he was for sway-wi' th' King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbowed-alas, poor Milan!- To most ignoble stooping.
 
Oh, the heavens!

Now the condition. The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit, Which was that he, in lieu o' th' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother. Whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to th' purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and, i' th' dead of darkness, The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self.
 
Alack, for pity! I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again. It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to 't.

Well demanded, wench. My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set A mark so bloody on the business, but With colors fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged, Nor tackle, sail, nor mast. The very rats Instinctively had quit it. There they hoist us To cry to th' sea that roared to us, to sigh To th' winds whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong.
 
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!
 
Oh, a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile Infused with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burthen groaned; which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue.
 
How came we ashore?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 26 --%%--
 
By providence divine. Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much. So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.
 
Would I might But ever see that man!
 
Now I arise.  <i>(stands and puts on his mantle)</i>  Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. Here in this island we arrived, and here Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princesses can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure, be 't to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds. To thy strong bidding, task Ariel and all his quality.
 
Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?
 
To every article. I boarded the king's ship. Now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement. Sometime I'd divide, And burn in many places. On the topmast, The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly, Then meet and join. Jove's lightning, the precursors O' th' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake.

Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me. The king's son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring-then, like reeds, not hair- Was the first man that leaped, cried, "Hell is empty And all the devils are here."
 
Why, that's my spirit! But was not this nigh shore?
 
Close by, my master.
 
But are they, Ariel, safe?
 
Not a hair perished. On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before. And, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. The king's son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.
 
Of the king's ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o' th' fleet.
 
Safely in harbor Is the king's ship. In the deep nook where once Thou called'st me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she's hid.

Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed. But there's more work. What is the time o' th' day?
 
Past the mid season.
 
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.

This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors. Thou, my slave, As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant. And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine, within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island- Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born-not honored with A human shape.

You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense. Would I had never Married my daughter there! For, coming thence, My son is lost and, in my rate, she too, Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her.-O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee?
 
Sir, he may live. I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs. He trod the water, Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted The surge most swoll'n that met him. His bold head 'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th' shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bowed, As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt He came alive to land.

No, no, he's gone.
 
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather loose her to an African, Where she at least is banished from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on 't.
 
Prithee, peace.
 
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' th' beam should bow. We have lost your son, I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them. The fault's your own.
 
So is the dearest o' th' loss.
 
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in. You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.
 
Very well.
 
And most chirurgeonly.

Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
 
He'd sow 't with nettle seed.
 
Or docks, or mallows.
 
And were the king on 't, what would I do?
 
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
 
I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things. For no kind of traffic Would I admit. No name of magistrate. Letters should not be known. Riches, poverty, And use of service-none. Contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard-none. No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil. No occupation. All men idle, all. And women too, but innocent and pure. No sovereignty-
 
Yet he would be king on 't.
 
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.
 
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor. Treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, Would I not have. But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.

There thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books; or with a log Batter his skull; or paunch him with a stake; Or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember First to possess his books, for without them He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command. They all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. He has brave utensils-for so he calls them- Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal. And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter. He himself Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman, But only Sycorax my dam and she. But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least.
 
Is it so brave a lass?
 
Ay, lord. She will become thy bed, I warrant. And bring thee forth brave brood.
 
Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen-save our graces!-and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.-Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?
 
Excellent.
 
Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee. But while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
 
Within this half hour will he be asleep. Wilt thou destroy him then?

Ay, on mine honor.
 
<i>(aside)</i> This will I tell my master.
 
Thou makest me merry. I am full of pleasure. Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch You taught me but whilere?
 
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.- Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.  <i>(sings)</i>  <i>Flout 'em and scout 'em</i>, <i>And scout 'em and flout 'em</i>. <i>Thought is free</i>.
 
That's not the tune.
 
What is this same?
 
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.
 
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou beest a devil, take 't as thou list.
 
O, forgive me my sins!
 
He that dies pays all debts.-I defy thee!-Mercy upon us!
 
Art thou afeard?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 132 --%%--
 
No, monster, not I.
 
Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again. And then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked I cried to dream again.
 
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
 
When Prospero is destroyed.
 
That shall be by and by. I remember the story.
 
The sound is going away. Let's follow it, and after do our work.

I have made you mad, And even with suchlike valor men hang and drown Their proper selves. <i>(some of the courtiers draw their swords)</i>  You fools, I and my fellows Are ministers of fate.

My fellow ministers Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted. But remember- For that's my business to you-that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero, Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child. For which foul deed The powers-delaying, not forgetting-have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, Against your peace.-Thee of thy son, Alonso, They have bereft, and do pronounce by me Lingering perdition, worse than any death Can be at once, shall step by step attend You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from- Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls Upon your heads-is nothing but hearts' sorrow And a clear life ensuing.

O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast of her, For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her.

Then as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow, but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both.

So I charmed their ears That, calflike, they my lowing followed through Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and thorns, Which entered their frail shins.

Sir, she is mortal. But by immortal providence, she's mine. I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one. She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before, of whom I have Received a second life. And second father This lady makes him to me.
 
I am hers. But oh, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!
 
There, sir, stop. Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that's gone.

I say amen, Gonzalo.
 
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars. In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis; And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves When no man was his own.

If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep And-how, we know not-all clapped under hatches, Where but even now with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, And more diversity of sounds, all horrible, We were awaked, straightway at liberty, Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our Master Capering to eye her. On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither.

If music be the food of love, play on. Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again, it had a dying fall.

O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou, That, notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soe'er, But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.

O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath killed the flock of all affections else That live in her, when liver, brain, and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled Her sweet perfections with one self king!

O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.
 
True, madam. And, to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself, Courage and hope both teaching him the practice, To a strong mast that lived upon the sea, Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see.

Orsino. I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.

What's she?
 
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died, for whose dear love, They say, she hath abjured the company And sight of men.
 
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.

By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
 
Why, let her except, before excepted.
 
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.
 
Confine? I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.

What's that to the purpose?
 
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
 
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats. He's a very fool and a prodigal.
 
Fie, that you'll say so! He plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.
 
He hath indeed, almost natural, for besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreler, and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, 'tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
 
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they?
 
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
 
With drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top. What, wench!  <i>Castiliano vulgo</i>, for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.

Good Mistress Mary Accost-
 
You mistake, knight. "Accost" is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.
 
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of "accost"?

A dry jest, sir.

Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.
 
O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?
 
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.

Why, would that have mended my hair?
 
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
 
But it becomes me well enough, does 't not?
 
Excellent. It hangs like flax on a distaff. And I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
 
Faith, I'll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen. Or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me. The count himself here hard by woos her.

Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.

Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.

Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend. For give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself. If he mend, he is no longer dishonest. If he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that's mended is but patched. Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so. If it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take away the fool. Therefore, I say again, take her away.

Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets.

Why, of mankind.

Of very ill manner. He'll speak with you, will you or no.

Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
 
It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone. If you have reason, be brief. 'Tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
 
Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
 
No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
 
Tell me your mind.
 
I am a messenger.
 
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
 
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.
 
Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?

The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead. To your ears, divinity. To any other's, profanation.
 
Give us the place alone. We will hear this divinity.
 
Now, sir, what is your text?
 
Most sweet lady-
 
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?
 
In Orsino's bosom.
 
In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?
 
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
 
Oh, I have read it. It is heresy. Have you no more to say?
 
Good madam, let me see your face.
 
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is 't not well done?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 52 --%%--
 
Excellently done, if God did all.
 
'Tis in grain, sir. 'Twill endure wind and weather.
 
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on. Lady, you are the cruel'st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy.
 
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted. I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labeled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?
 
I see you what you are, you are too proud. But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you. Oh, such love Could be but recompensed though you were crowned The nonpareil of beauty.
 
How does he love me?
 
With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
 
Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him. Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 54 --%%--
 
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him; He might have took his answer long ago.
 
If I did love you in my master's flame, With such a suffering, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense; I would not understand it.
 
Why, what would you?
 
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house. Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night. Halloo your name to the reverberate hills And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out "Olivia!" Oh, you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me.
 
You might do much. What is your parentage?
 
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman.
 
Get you to your lord. I cannot love him. Let him send no more- Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well. I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 56 --%%--
 
I am no fee'd post, lady. Keep your purse. My master, not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, And let your fervor, like my master's, be Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.
 
"What is your parentage?" "Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman." I'll be sworn thou art; Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit, Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft, soft! Unless the master were the man. How now? Even so quickly may one catch the plague? Methinks I feel this youth's perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.- What ho, Malvolio!
 
Here, madam, at your service.
 
Run after that same peevish messenger, The county's man. He left this ring behind him, Would I or not. Tell him I'll none of it. OLIVIA <i>hands him a ring</i>  Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes. I am not for him. If that the youth will come this way tomorrow, I'll give him reasons for 't. Hie thee, Malvolio.

I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe. What is decreed must be, and be this so.

Will you stay no longer, nor will you not that I go with you?
 
By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
 
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
 
No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
 
Alas the day!

A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
 
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
 
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
 
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.
 
If you will not undo what you have done-that is, kill him whom you have recovered-desire it not. Fare you well at once. My bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court. Farewell.
 
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsino's court, Else would I very shortly see thee there. But, come what may, I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.

Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
 
Even now, sir. On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.
 
She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
 
She took the ring of me. I'll none of it.
 
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her will is it should be so returned. <i>(he throws down the ring)</i> If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye. If not, be it his that finds it.
 
I left no ring with her. What means this lady? Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her! She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger.

Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we, For such as we are made of, such we be. How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly, And I, poor monster, fond as much on him, And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my master's love. As I am woman, now, alas the day, What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe! O time, thou must untangle this, not I. It is too hard a knot for me to untie!

Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes, and <i>diluculo surgere,</i> thou know'st,-
 
Nay, my troth, I know not. But I know to be up late is to be up late.
 
A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early, so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the four elements?
 
Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.

I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio's nose is no whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
 
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?

We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
 
Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you are welcome to the house. If not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.

Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.

Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favor at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by this hand.

Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it.
 
Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.
 
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
 
O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog!
 
What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?
 
I have no exquisite reason for 't, but I have reason good enough.
 
The devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.
 
What wilt thou do?
 
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the color of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion,he shall find himself most feelingly personated.

I can write very like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.
 
Excellent! I smell a device.
 
I have 't in my nose too.
 
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she's in love with him.
 
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.
 
And your horse now would make him an ass.
 
Ass, I doubt not.
 
Oh, 'twill be admirable!
 
Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
 
Good night, Penthesilea.

Give me some music. (<i>music plays</i>) Now, good morrow, friends.- Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night. Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times: Come, but one verse.
 
He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.
 
Who was it?
 
Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
 
Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
 
(<i>to</i> VIOLA<i>)</i> Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For such as I am, all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
 
It gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is throned.

Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon 't, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves. Hath it not, boy?
 
A little, by your favor.
 
What kind of woman is't?
 
Of your complexion.
 
She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
 
About your years, my lord.
 
Too old by heaven. Let still the woman take An elder than herself. So wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband's heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women's are.
 
I think it well, my lord.
 
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent. For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.
 
And so they are. Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!

O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.- Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it. It is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love, Like the old age.
 
Are you ready, sir?
 
Ay; prithee, sing.

No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.

Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
 
Give me now leave to leave thee.
 
Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere, for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
 
Let all the rest give place.
 
Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty. Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
 
But if she cannot love you, sir?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 94 --%%--
 
I cannot be so answer'd.
 
Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her. You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?
 
There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart. No woman's heart So big, to hold so much. They lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia.
 
Ay, but I know-
 
What dost thou know?
 
Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship.
 
And what's her history?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 96 --%%--
 
A blank, my lord. She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud, Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought, And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like patience on a monument, Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more, but indeed Our shows are more than will, for still we prove Much in our vows, but little in our love.
 
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
 
I am all the daughters of my father's house, And all the brothers too-and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady?
 
Ay, that's the theme. To her in haste. Give her this jewel. Say My love can give no place, bide no denay.  <i>(he hands her a jewel)</i>

She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript.

Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.
 
O, by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him. But, would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres.

Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.
 
As plain as I see you now.
 
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
 
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
 
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.
 
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.
 
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness.

The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy.
 
An 't be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
 
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor.
 
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
 
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
 
Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou "thou"-est him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down. Go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.

Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.
 
And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.

The offence is not of such a bloody nature; Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear.

Oh, ho! Do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that in the letter. "Cast thy humble slough," says she. "Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang with arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity," and consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, "Let this fellow be looked to." "Fellow!" Not "Malvolio," nor after my degree, but "fellow." Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance-what can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

That defense thou hast, betake thee to 't. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.
 
You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man.
 
You'll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.
 
I pray you, sir, what is he?
 
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word. "Give 't or take 't."

I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor. Belike this is a man of that quirk.
 
Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury. Therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
 
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
 
I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.
 
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
 
I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrament, but nothing of the circumstance more.
 
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
 
Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor. He is, indeed, sir, the most skillful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.

I shall be much bound to you for 't. I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my mettle.
 
Why, man, he's a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable. And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
 
Pox on 't! I'll not meddle with him.
 
Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.
 
Plague on 't, an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, gray Capilet.
 
I'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on 't. This shall end without the perdition of souls. <i>(aside)</i> Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.

<i>(to</i> FABIAN<i>)</i> I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
 
He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
 
<i>(to</i> VIOLA<i>)</i> There's no remedy, sir; he will fight with you for 's oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not hurt you.
 
<i>(aside)</i> Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
 
Give ground, if you see him furious.
 
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy. The gentleman will, for his honor's sake, have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it. But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on, to 't.
 
Pray God, he keep his oath!
 
I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
 
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me. If you offend him, I for him defy you.

Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised you, I'll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily and reins well.
 
This is the man. Do thy office.
 
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
 
You do mistake me, sir.
 
No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.- Take him away. He knows I know him well.

Come, sir, away.
 
<i>(to</i> VIOLA<i>)</i> I must entreat of you some of that money.
 
What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have showed me here, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I'll lend you something. My having is not much. I'll make division of my present with you. Hold, there's half my coffer. <i>(offering him money)</i>
 
Will you deny me now? Is 't possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you.
 
I know of none, Nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood-

The man grows mad. Away with him. Come, come, sir.
 
Lead me on.
 
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself. So do not I. Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

Bonos dies, Sir Toby. For, as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, "That that is is." So I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson. For, what is "that" but "that," and "is" but "is"?

Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.
 
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayest thou that house is dark?

Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony. And yet complainest thou of obstruction?
 
I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.

For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad- Or else the lady's mad.

Notable pirate! Thou saltwater thief, What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies, Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies?
 
Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me. Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither. That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem. A wreck past hope he was. His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication. For his sake Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town, Drew to defend him when he was beset, Where being apprehended, his false cunning, (Not meaning to partake with me in danger) Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty-years-removed thing While one would wink, denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before.

Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?-A savage jealousy That sometimes savors nobly. But hear me this: Since you to nonregardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favor, Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still. But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crowned in his master's spite. Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in mischief: I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
 
And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons! A natural perspective, that is and is not!
 
Antonio, O my dear Antonio! How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee!
 
Sebastian are you?
 
Fear'st thou that, Antonio?

How have you made division of yourself? An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
 
Most wonderful!
 
<i>(looking at</i> VIOLA<i>)</i> Do I stand there? I never had a brother; Nor can there be that deity in my nature, Of here and everywhere. I had a sister, Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured. Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman? What name? What parentage?
 
Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb. If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us.
 
A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say "Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!"
 
My father had a mole upon his brow.
 
And so had mine.
 
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years.

Oh, that record is lively in my soul! He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years.
 
If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurped attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola. Which to confirm, I'll bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count. All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord.
 
<i>(to</i> OLIVIA<i>)</i> So comes it, lady, you have been mistook. But nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived. You are betrothed both to a maid and man.
 
<i>(to</i> OLIVIA<i>)</i> Be not amazed. Right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wreck.  <i>(to</i> VIOLA<i>)</i> Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
 
And all those sayings will I overswear; And those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbed continent the fire That severs day from night.
 
Give me thy hand, And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.

The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments. He, upon some action, Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
 
He shall enlarge him.
 
Fetch Malvolio hither: And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract. A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his.  <i>(to</i> FOOL<i>)</i> How does he, sirrah?
 
Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here writ a letter to you. I should have given 't you today morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.
 
Open 't, and read it.
 
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman. <i>(reads)</i> "By the Lord, madam,"-
 
How now? Art thou mad?
 
No, madam, I do but read madness. An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow <i>vox.</i>
 
Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
 
--%%-- pageNum: 234 --%%--
 
So I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to read thus. Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
 
(<i>giving the letter to</i> FABIAN) Read it you, sirrah.
 
<i>(reads)</i>   "By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury. The madly used Malvolio."
 
Did he write this?
 
Ay, madam.
 
This savors not much of distraction.
 
See him delivered, Fabian; bring him hither.
 
My lord so please you, these things further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown the alliance on 't, so please you, Here at my house and at my proper cost.

Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.  <i>(to</i> VIOLA<i>)</i>  Your master quits you, and for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding, And since you called me "master" for so long, Here is my hand. You shall from this time be Your master's mistress.
 
<i>(to</i> VIOLA<i>)</i> A sister! You are she.
 
Is this the madman?
 
Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio!
 
Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong.
 
Have I, Malvolio? No.
 
<i>(handing a paper)</i>   Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand. Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase; Or say 'tis not your seal, not your invention: You can say none of this. Well, grant it then And tell me, in the modesty of honor, Why you have given me such clear lights of favor, Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?
 
--%%-- pageNum: 238 --%%--
 
And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That e'er invention played on? Tell me why.
 
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character. But out of question, 'tis Maria's hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content. This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee; But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause.
 
Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceived against him. Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby's great importance, In recompense whereof he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was followed, May rather pluck on laughter than revenge, If that the injuries be justly weighed That have on both sides passed.
 
<i>(to</i> MALVOLIO<i>)</i> Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
 
--%%-- pageNum: 240 --%%--
 
Why, "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them." I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that's all one. <i>(imitates</i>  MALVOLIO<i>)</i> "By the Lord, fool, I am not mad."-But do you remember? "Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal; an you smile not, he's gagged?" and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
 
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
 
He hath been most notoriously abused.
 
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.
 
He hath not told us of the captain yet. When that is known and golden time convents, A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls.-Meantime, sweet sister, We will not part from hence. Cesario, come, For so you shall be, while you are a man. But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
