Perchance ? 
Nay , and most like . 
You must not stay here longer . 
Your dismission Is come from Caesar . 
Therefore hear it , Antony . 
Where's Fulvia's process ? 
Caesar's, I would say-both ? 
Call in the messengers . 
As I am Egypt's queen , Thou blushest , Antony , and that blood of thine Is Caesar's homager . 
Else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill - tongued Fulvia scolds . 
The messengers !
