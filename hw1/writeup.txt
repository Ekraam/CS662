Writeup for HW1 - CS662
Ekraam Sabir

The sketches for FSAs and FSTs are included as separate image files.

Beyond the immediate observations listed in the sections below, I gained familiarity with carmel.

1. spanish.fsa

   The FSA included in the submission has 235,644 transitions, 142899 states and 92746 paths (the number of words in the vocabulary) and a single cycle to repeat words with spaces - "_". The starting idea with which I built this fsa was to reuse the substrings as much as possible. The current submission uses only the matching prefixes. I also tried matching suffixes, which reduced the transitions by half, but created a lot of cycles in the FSA (which is undesirable as it leads to the possiblity of more paths - accepting words outside the vocabulary)

   Some thoughts on improvement - While there may be a few heuristics to improve the current submission (reuse suffixes that only go forward in the fsa etc.), my best guess of an algorithm to create a more compact FSA for the given vocabulary is to work along the lines of dijsktras algorithm. Specifically, create a graph with forward connecting edges with all possible conenctions for depth = maximum occuring word length. Use Dijkstra's to iterate through the vocabulary list and come up with paths that are used atleast once. The remaining would be redundant and can be removed.

2. vowel-deleter.fst

   The submission for this follows the question to the word. Terminate a vowel with prejudice.

   Forward

   Input from the question: ' "G" "A" "T" "O" "_" "A" "Q" "U" "I" '
   Output from the fsa: "G" "T" "_" "Q"

   Backward (vowel restoration)

   Input from the qeustion: ' "P" "R" "R" "_" "Q" '
   Top few outputs when using the k flag: "P" "R" "R" "_" "Q"
       	   	   	      	    	  "P" "R" "R" "_" "Q" "O"
   A random output down the order: "I" "I" "P" "I" "I" "R" "R" "_" "E" "E" "E" "E" "Q" "U" "A"

   While this may be called a vowel-restorer, it adds vowels for no rhyme and reason. An improvement to this would be the question 6 later down, where  maybe we can condition the restoration on probabilities based off the vocabulary words/bigrams.

3. space-deleter.fst

   This is very similar to the vowel-deleter in implementation, except it removes spaces ("_").

   Forward
   
   Input: ' "P" "R" "R" "_" "Q" '
   Output: "P" "R" "R" "Q"

   Backward

   Input: "P" "R" "R" "Q"
   Output: "P" "R" "R" "Q" "_"
   
   A random output further down the order: "P" "R" "_" "_" "_" "_" "R" "_" "_" "_" "_" "_" "Q" "_" "_" "_"

   A backward input of "P" "R" "R" "_" "Q" produces no valid path indicating that the existence of spaces is not possible in the output.

4. typo.fst

   The structure of this fst differs somewhat from the previous two. Mainly because it has to gurantee a few things: every third character has to be replaced, spaces don't count and it still has to consider that string length may not be in multiples of 3.

   I also involved the use of probability to generate the typos. Though it should not have been necessary for equally likely events.

   Forward

   Input: ' "G" "A" "T" "O" "_" "A" "Q" "U" "I" '
   Outputs: "G" "A" "Y" "O" "_" "A" "W" "U" "I"
   	    "G" "A" "G" "O" "_" "A" "A" "U" "I"
	    "G" "A" "Y" "O" "_" "A" "A" "U" "I"

   Backward

   Input: '"G" "A" "T" "O" "_" "A" "Q" "U" "I" '
   Output: "G" "A" "Y" "O" "_" "A" "W" "U" "I"
   	   "G" "A" "Y" "O" "_" "A" "A" "U" "I"
   	   "G" "A" "R" "O" "_" "A" "A" "U" "I"

   An output string can also be its own input as shown in the first output for both forward and backward.

5. spell.fst

   This fst seems more like implementing the given rules for the converion. I added equal probabilities in the cases where we have the liberty to choose the alphabets to be assigned to the phoneme. While it doesn't make any difference in the current case, it can be used to bias the results for a bettter output.

   Forward
   
   Input: ' "pho-k" "pho-a" "pho-y" "pho-e" '
   Output: C Y E
   	   C Y E H

   Backward:
   
   Input: ' "C" "A" "L" "L" "E" '
   Outputs: pho-k pho-u pho-a pho-l pho-l pho-e
   	    pho-k pho-r pho-a pho-l pho-l pho-e
	    pho-k pho-o pho-a pho-l pho-l pho-e
	    pho-k pho-l pho-a pho-l pho-l pho-e
	    pho-k pho-a pho-a pho-l pho-l pho-e

6. Improvements using spanish.fsa

   My understanding of this question is that we can use spanish.fsa to filter out meaningless outputs that we get from the fsts.

   Some of the improvements when we cascade spanish.fsa and filter out the unwanted sequences generated in the restoration process are listed in the following examples:

   i. vowel-deleter (backward - vowel restoration)

   input: "B" "N" "D" "N"
   output without spanish.fsa: "B" "N" "D" "N"
   	  	  	       "B" "N" "D" "N" "O"
			       "B" "N" "D" "N"
			       "B" "N" "D" "N" "O" "O"
   output with spanish.fsa: "A" "B" "U" "N" "D" "A" "N"

   ABUNDAN is a word in spanishvocab while BNDNO or BNDNOO are not.

   ii. space-deleter.fst (backward - space insertion)

   input: "A" "B" "A"
   output without spanish.fsa: "_" "_" "A" "_" "B" "_" "A" "_"
   	  	  	       "A" "B" "A"
   output with spanish.fsa: "A" "_" "B" "A"
   	       		    "A" "B" "A"
			    "A" "B" "_" "A"

   A, AB, ABA and BA are all valid words in spanishvocab

   iii. typo.fst (backward typo correction)

   input: "A" "B" "S"
   output without spanish.fsa: "A" "B" "Z"
   	  	  	       "A" "B" "S"
			       "A" "B" "D"
			       "A" "B" "S"
			       "A" "B" "W"
   output with spanish.fsa: "A" "B" "D"
   	       		    "A" "B" "S"
			    "A" "B" "D"
			    "A" "B" "S"
			    "A" "B" "A"

   ABA, ABD, ABS are valid words, while ABZ and ABW are not

   iv. spell.fst (forward phonemeToText)

   input: '"pho-k" "pho-u" "pho-a" "pho-l" "pho-l" "pho-e"'
   output without spanish.fsa: C A L L E
   	  	  	       C A L L E H
			       C A L L H E
			       C A L L E H H
   output with spanish.fsa: C A L L E

   While H has been denoted as silent (doing nothing) in the spanish phoneme rules, it makes more sense to have a word with the right spelling - without interspersed with a lot of unnecessary H.
